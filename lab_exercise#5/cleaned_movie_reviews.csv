mayor is dedicating a statue to the citizens of the city after the unveiling the crowd finds a little tramp charlie chaplin sleeping on the lap of one of the figures as he tries to climb down he encounters one problem after another this opening scene alone is priceless with such a great beginning chaplin adds in more comedic insertions blended into the plot the theme to city lights is remembered mainly about a tramps love for a blind girl however there is a subplot involving the tramps involvement with a millionaire drunk which by far takes up more time than the sentimental love story these two segments actually set the pattern first segment set in the afternoon finds charlie walking down the street examining a nude statue in a shop being annoyed by some newsboys making fun of his tattered clothing he encounters a beautiful blonde girl virginia cherrill selling flowers after she drops one of her flowers charlie notices her feeling about the sidewalk for it thus realizing

in gratitude for saving his life takes charlie under his wing to accompany him to various night clubs until dawn by morning the millionaire now sober fails to recognize or remember charlie and orders

through his encounters with the drunk and their all night binges by day charlie looks after the blind girl and worries when shes not at her usual corner selling flowers finding that shes ill and being cared by her grandmother florence lee whose behind with her rent and threatened with eviction charlie offers to help by obtaining and losing various jobs ranging from streetcleaning to fighting in a boxing match reading in a newspaper of a european doctor who restores sight for the blind charlie gives the girl  for an operation the money offered to him by the drunken millionaire who after sober

"city lights (1931)","a oneman virtuoso performance","nazifighterdavid","city lights united artists  written directed and starring charlie chaplin  l is a silent comedydrama released at the height of the sound era distributing a movie in the silent film tradition at the time when silents were considered a fad chaplin gambled with this production and made it pay off although chaplin hails the gold rush  as the one movie he would most want to be remembered city lights nearly dims out his gold rush and at the same time practically places his other silent masterpiece the circus  to oblivion city lights has stood the test of time balancing perfectly a mixture of comedy and drama but in chaplins case pathossubtitled a comedy romance in pantomime the story opens in the early morning where the mayor is dedicating a statue to the citizens of the city after the unveiling the crowd finds a little tramp charlie chaplin sleeping on the lap of one of the figures as he tries to climb down he encounters one problem after another this opening scene alone is priceless with such a great beginning chaplin adds in more comedic insertions blended into the plot the theme to city lights is remembered mainly about a tramps love for a blind girl however there is a subplot involving the tramps involvement with a millionaire drunk which by far takes up more time than the sentimental love story these two segments actually set the pattern first segment set in the afternoon finds charlie walking down the street examining a nude statue in a shop being annoyed by some newsboys making fun of his tattered clothing he encounters a beautiful blonde girl virginia cherrill selling flowers after she drops one of her flowers charlie notices her feeling about the sidewalk for it thus realizing shes blind smitten by her beauty he picks it up and pays her for it minutes later the slamming of a limousine door is heard with the girl believing the kind gentleman charlie to be a millionaire second segment set at night finds charlie encountering a drunk harry myers trying to commit suicide by drowning himself just as charlie is about to save him he in turn falls into the river the drunk in gratitude for saving his life takes charlie under his wing to accompany him to various night clubs until dawn by morning the millionaire now sober fails to recognize or remember charlie and orders orders his butler to escort this stranger out of his mansion this running gag thats repeated in the story might play itself as repetitious but chaplin manages to breathe new life and funnier routines through his encounters with the drunk and their all night binges by day charlie looks after the blind girl and worries when shes not at her usual corner selling flowers finding that shes ill and being cared by her grandmother florence lee whose behind with her rent and threatened with eviction charlie offers to help by obtaining and losing various jobs ranging from streetcleaning to fighting in a boxing match reading in a newspaper of a european doctor who restores sight for the blind charlie gives the girl  for an operation the money offered to him by the drunken millionaire who after sober accuses charlie of robbing him has his arrested and serving jail time the climatic finish is truly the best thing chaplin has ever done and certainly one not to be missedfeatured in the supporting cast are henry bergman allan garcia albert austin and hank mann while much has been discussed about chaplins performance his costar virginia cherrill as the blind girl no name given should not go without mention even though her future film career consisted of forgettable programmers and at one time being one of the future wives of film actor cary grant her performance is excellent by all means although its been said that future film star jean harlow  appears as an unbilled extra in the night club sequence she is visible in a surviving still photograph but no such scene appears in the finished product unlike the gold rush city lights had limited showings in revival houses in later years and was never allowed to be distributed to television being first introduced to city lights at new york citys revival movie house the regency theater formerly located on broadway and th street in  the memorable thing about this event are the roars of laughter from its theater packed audience there was one man probably a big fan reliving his childhood memories whose laughter almost drowned out the underscoring of the film no doubt he was having more fun watching this movie than anyone else watching city lights surrounded by an appreciative audience theater is one way to truly appreciate and experience the feel of silent film comedy and to think back as to how the audience reacted in same back in after chaplins death in december of  city lights along with his other silent features were not only resurrected for a new generation to endure but became readily available on video cassette at the time of chaplins th birthday  in later years city lights was frequently revived on various cable channels ranging from turner network television tnt in the early s american movie classics up to  and finally turner classic movies the complete musical soundtrack that accompanies city lights happens to be the original score composed to perfection by chaplin himself much has been written and said about city lights over the years to learn more about the making difficulties and long term preparations to city lights either watch kevin blownlows  documentary hollywood a celebration of the american silent film as narrated by james mason or brownlows other documentaries dedicated entirely to chaplins career including outtakes to city lights as well as scenes involving

magic act  the prestige  is of the essence and preluding it is the pledge followed by the turn together these three key components are slotted in unique positions in the prestiges arrestingly clever

see how their friendship abruptly becomes a fullyfledged rivalry and hostility with a magic act gone horribly wrong in front of an audience there is a death and it lights the fuse of an onslaught of

movie and i agree know that this is not a gotchakind of shyamalan trick where you want to stop the film rewind it and watch it meticulous foreshadowing up to the cheap payoff but a tightlywritten evershifting hall of mirrors with so many intrinsic twists that on your way home you will still be scratching you head and searching for cluesour two magicians are perfectlycast with hugh jackman capturing the showy slick ambitiondriven nature of his character angier in contrast to bales techniquedriven purist who may be well on his way to perfecting the craft but lacks the abracadabra entertainment value i had always crowned the latter the more capable actor of the two but the fact is that jackman performs just as well in the film having said that borden has more layers to his complex contradictory keyword persona than the flashy greedy angier which perhaps begs more weight from the actor behind the role shifting more demand on christian bale the sad fact of it is that neither of these two men are likable characters and elicit nothing more than temporary sympathy however the secrecy with which the intricate story approaches them makes it impossible for the viewer to slot them in protagonist vs antagonist positions and indeed they are given almost the exact same screentime and voiceover narration throughout a subtle and brilliant accolade of nolansto further evaluate the cast of the prestige david bowie and michael caine undoubtedly merit a great deal of praise for supporting the two moody unlikeable leading men it is a crying shame then that scarlett johansson  always an incapable actress except for the rare occasions in which she plays a sultry american vixen match point  performs so badly in the role of olivia wenscombe a magic assistant pending between borden and angier here she is actually given a very good and important character who is not necessarily bad like the rest but botches her interpretation by giving an unspeakably hammy london accent nolan picks up on her shortcomings as an actress and resorts to boobshots en masse this he should be fully entitled to do as a director for a beautiful diversion will always camouflage the process and any of its potential missteps as michael caines character puts forwardwith scarlett as a pleasurable paintjob twists by the bucketload and flashy magic tricks as windowdressing to a solid

"the prestige (2006)","give this film time to sink in","gavin","director christopher nolan has a proclivity for warped narratives memento and in the prestige he serves up a deliciously twisty tale puffed full of magic theatricality and inventive cinematic devices with his remarkably sleightofhand direction he spins the tale of two rivaling magicians in victorianera london creating a cerebrally stimulating  hour long miseenscene in which the audience is literally left guessing and gasping at its rare uniqueness through magic acts and bitter behindthestage intriguethe final payoff of any magic act  the prestige  is of the essence and preluding it is the pledge followed by the turn together these three key components are slotted in unique positions in the prestiges arrestingly clever script but it is the titular act that propels the film the pledge introduces our main characters magicians alfred borden christian bale and robert angier hugh jackman in turnofthecentury london and we see how their friendship abruptly becomes a fullyfledged rivalry and hostility with a magic act gone horribly wrong in front of an audience there is a death and it lights the fuse of an onslaught of reel revelations and the oneupmanship that will ensue between the two competitors the turn comes to offers twists by the bucketload in the form of loveinterests and technologically marvelous magic acts i gasped i scratched my head i watched on in awe no description will do it justicethe prestige as the end note to the show  in which for example the disappearer reappears to the deafening applause of the crowd  is so meticulously composed in the film through foreshadowing and fractured chronology that rigorously intersects intertwines intercuts fastforwards rewinds and replays key parts of the story that the whole spectacle floors you christopher nolan and his brother jonathan have worked out a template script that is more twisty and turny than a mountain road and for that reason i am very reluctant to spoil even the slightest detail of the story of the prestige of all of its acts in fact if you are shaking your head thinking a clever twist ending does not make the movie and i agree know that this is not a gotchakind of shyamalan trick where you want to stop the film rewind it and watch it meticulous foreshadowing up to the cheap payoff but a tightlywritten evershifting hall of mirrors with so many intrinsic twists that on your way home you will still be scratching you head and searching for cluesour two magicians are perfectlycast with hugh jackman capturing the showy slick ambitiondriven nature of his character angier in contrast to bales techniquedriven purist who may be well on his way to perfecting the craft but lacks the abracadabra entertainment value i had always crowned the latter the more capable actor of the two but the fact is that jackman performs just as well in the film having said that borden has more layers to his complex contradictory keyword persona than the flashy greedy angier which perhaps begs more weight from the actor behind the role shifting more demand on christian bale the sad fact of it is that neither of these two men are likable characters and elicit nothing more than temporary sympathy however the secrecy with which the intricate story approaches them makes it impossible for the viewer to slot them in protagonist vs antagonist positions and indeed they are given almost the exact same screentime and voiceover narration throughout a subtle and brilliant accolade of nolansto further evaluate the cast of the prestige david bowie and michael caine undoubtedly merit a great deal of praise for supporting the two moody unlikeable leading men it is a crying shame then that scarlett johansson  always an incapable actress except for the rare occasions in which she plays a sultry american vixen match point  performs so badly in the role of olivia wenscombe a magic assistant pending between borden and angier here she is actually given a very good and important character who is not necessarily bad like the rest but botches her interpretation by giving an unspeakably hammy london accent nolan picks up on her shortcomings as an actress and resorts to boobshots en masse this he should be fully entitled to do as a director for a beautiful diversion will always camouflage the process and any of its potential missteps as michael caines character puts forwardwith scarlett as a pleasurable paintjob twists by the bucketload and flashy magic tricks as windowdressing to a solid mystery film there is little or no need to delve deeper into the psyches of its characters to keep our attention yet this is done and superbly so by christopher nolan antihero gets a whole new spin to it in the prestige with two friendsturnedrivals so bitterly poised on the brink of obsession of outshining the other that succeeding with the ultimate prestige of magic followed by applause is enough to drive them to murder bankruptcy deceit and sabotage borden simply wants to be better on a technical level while angier wants the publics recognition and widespread fame their ambition is in effect largely the same create the definitive deceptive illusion and do it through any means necessarythe prestige is a majestic film that nevertheless spans across too long a running time condensation would have done wonders and surely bumped it up a notch as would underpinning some humour at one or two points it is very gloomy but it truly is a great cinematic achievement and a shoein for my top  of

"the prestige (2006)","give this film time to sink in","gavin","director christopher nolan has a proclivity for warped narratives memento and in the prestige he serves up a deliciously twisty tale puffed full of magic theatricality and inventive cinematic devices with his remarkably sleightofhand direction he spins the tale of two rivaling magicians in victorianera london creating a cerebrally stimulating  hour long miseenscene in which the audience is literally left guessing and gasping at its rare uniqueness through magic acts and bitter behindthestage intriguethe final payoff of any magic act  the prestige  is of the essence and preluding it is the pledge followed by the turn together these three key components are slotted in unique positions in the prestiges arrestingly clever script but it is the titular act that propels the film the pledge introduces our main characters magicians alfred borden christian bale and robert angier hugh jackman in turnofthecentury london and we see how their friendship abruptly becomes a fullyfledged rivalry and hostility with a magic act gone horribly wrong in front of an audience there is a death and it lights the fuse of an onslaught of reel revelations and the oneupmanship that will ensue between the two competitors the turn comes to offers twists by the bucketload in the form of loveinterests and technologically marvelous magic acts i gasped i scratched my head i watched on in awe no description will do it justicethe prestige as the end note to the show  in which for example the disappearer reappears to the deafening applause of the crowd  is so meticulously composed in the film through foreshadowing and fractured chronology that rigorously intersects intertwines intercuts fastforwards rewinds and replays key parts of the story that the whole spectacle floors you christopher nolan and his brother jonathan have worked out a template script that is more twisty and turny than a mountain road and for that reason i am very reluctant to spoil even the slightest detail of the story of the prestige of all of its acts in fact if you are shaking your head thinking a clever twist ending does not make the movie and i agree know that this is not a gotchakind of shyamalan trick where you want to stop the film rewind it and watch it meticulous foreshadowing up to the cheap payoff but a tightlywritten evershifting hall of mirrors with so many intrinsic twists that on your way home you will still be scratching you head and searching for cluesour two magicians are perfectlycast with hugh jackman capturing the showy slick ambitiondriven nature of his character angier in contrast to bales techniquedriven purist who may be well on his way to perfecting the craft but lacks the abracadabra entertainment value i had always crowned the latter the more capable actor of the two but the fact is that jackman performs just as well in the film having said that borden has more layers to his complex contradictory keyword persona than the flashy greedy angier which perhaps begs more weight from the actor behind the role shifting more demand on christian bale the sad fact of it is that neither of these two men are likable characters and elicit nothing more than temporary sympathy however the secrecy with which the intricate story approaches them makes it impossible for the viewer to slot them in protagonist vs antagonist positions and indeed they are given almost the exact same screentime and voiceover narration throughout a subtle and brilliant accolade of nolansto further evaluate the cast of the prestige david bowie and michael caine undoubtedly merit a great deal of praise for supporting the two moody unlikeable leading men it is a crying shame then that scarlett johansson  always an incapable actress except for the rare occasions in which she plays a sultry american vixen match point  performs so badly in the role of olivia wenscombe a magic assistant pending between borden and angier here she is actually given a very good and important character who is not necessarily bad like the rest but botches her interpretation by giving an unspeakably hammy london accent nolan picks up on her shortcomings as an actress and resorts to boobshots en masse this he should be fully entitled to do as a director for a beautiful diversion will always camouflage the process and any of its potential missteps as michael caines character puts forwardwith scarlett as a pleasurable paintjob twists by the bucketload and flashy magic tricks as windowdressing to a solid mystery film there is little or no need to delve deeper into the psyches of its characters to keep our attention yet this is done and superbly so by christopher nolan antihero gets a whole new spin to it in the prestige with two friendsturnedrivals so bitterly poised on the brink of obsession of outshining the other that succeeding with the ultimate prestige of magic followed by applause is enough to drive them to murder bankruptcy deceit and sabotage borden simply wants to be better on a technical level while angier wants the publics recognition and widespread fame their ambition is in effect largely the same create the definitive deceptive illusion and do it through any means necessarythe prestige is a majestic film that nevertheless spans across too long a running time condensation would have done wonders and surely bumped it up a notch as would underpinning some humour at one or two points it is very gloomy but it truly is a great cinematic achievement and a shoein for my top  of

puffed full of magic theatricality and inventive cinematic devices with his remarkably sleightofhand direction he spins the tale of two rivaling magicians in victorianera london creating a cerebrally stimulating  hour long miseenscene in which the audience is literally left guessing and gasping at its rare uniqueness through magic acts and bitter behindthestage intriguethe final payoff of any magic act  the prestige  is of the essence and preluding it is the pledge followed by the turn together these three key components are slotted in unique positions in the prestiges arrestingly clever script but it is the titular act that propels the film the pledge introduces our main characters magicians alfred borden christian bale and robert angier hugh jackman in turnofthecentury london and we see how their friendship abruptly becomes a fullyfledged rivalry and hostility with a magic act gone horribly wrong in front of an audience there is a death and it lights the fuse of an onslaught of reel revelations and the oneupmanship that will ensue between the two competitors the turn comes to offers twists by the bucketload in the form of loveinterests and technologically marvelous magic

parts of the story that the whole spectacle floors you christopher nolan and his brother jonathan have worked out a template script that is more twisty and turny than a mountain road and for that reason i am very reluctant to spoil even the slightest detail of the story of the prestige of all of its acts in fact if you are shaking your head thinking a clever twist ending does not make the movie and i agree know that this is not a gotchakind of shyamalan trick where you want to stop the film rewind it and watch it meticulous foreshadowing up to the cheap payoff but a tightlywritten evershifting hall of mirrors with so many intrinsic twists that on your way home you will still be scratching you head and searching for cluesour two magicians are perfectlycast with hugh jackman capturing the showy slick ambitiondriven nature of his character angier in contrast to bales techniquedriven purist who may be well on his way to perfecting the craft but lacks the abracadabra entertainment value i had always crowned the latter the more capable actor of the two but the fact is that jackman performs just as well in the film having said that borden has more layers to his complex contradictory keyword persona than the flashy greedy angier which perhaps begs more weight from the actor behind the role shifting more demand on christian bale the sad fact of it is that neither of these two men are likable characters and elicit nothing more than temporary sympathy however the secrecy with which the intricate story approaches them makes it impossible for the viewer to slot them in protagonist vs antagonist positions and indeed they are given almost the exact same screentime and voiceover narration throughout a subtle and brilliant accolade of nolansto further evaluate the cast of the prestige david bowie and michael caine undoubtedly merit a great deal of praise for supporting the two moody unlikeable leading men it is a crying shame then that scarlett johansson  always an incapable actress except for the rare occasions in which she plays a sultry american vixen match point  performs so badly in the role of olivia wenscombe a magic assistant pending between borden and angier here she is actually given a very good and important character who is not necessarily bad like the rest but botches her interpretation by giving an unspeakably hammy london accent nolan picks up on her shortcomings as an actress and resorts to boobshots en masse this he should be fully entitled to do as a director for a beautiful diversion will always camouflage the process and any of its potential missteps as michael caines character puts forwardwith scarlett as a pleasurable paintjob twists by the bucketload and flashy magic tricks as windowdressing to a solid mystery film there is little or no need to delve deeper into the psyches of its characters to keep our attention yet this is done and superbly so by christopher nolan antihero gets a whole new spin to it in the prestige with two friendsturnedrivals so bitterly poised on the brink of obsession of outshining the other that succeeding with the ultimate prestige of magic followed by applause is enough to drive them to murder bankruptcy deceit and sabotage borden simply wants to be better on a technical level while angier wants the publics recognition and widespread fame their ambition is in effect largely the same create the definitive deceptive illusion and do it through any means necessarythe prestige is a majestic film that nevertheless spans across too long a running time condensation would have done wonders and surely bumped it up a notch as would underpinning some humour at one or two points it is very gloomy but it truly is a great cinematic achievement and a shoein for my top  of

"madame web (2024)","i am filled with hatred it cant get any worse","olcare","first impressionthe opening of the madame web was immersed in a mystique and ambition enhanced by great musical score yet as the movie progresses it becomes a mixed bag and a rollercoaster of emotionsthe positivemusical score and sound design the standout feature of madame web is its musical score the soundtrack not only enhances the emotional depth of the film but also succeeds in creating in some moments genuine goosebumps the sound design really enhances this impact by carefully using sound pans bass and reverse effects it creates a sense of tension and immersion which is one of the films strongest featuresthe mixedvisual effects and costume design some of the visual effects in madame web were visually appealing the costume design like caseys red jacket and the three spider girl villain outfits standing out as particularly stunning contributions to the films aesthetic but it was not often shown in the film since the films direction and focus was different i was disappointedacting and direction although i thought caseys character development  her ability to see the world from a different perspective  was great i didnt like how it was visually presented the way it was edited was poorly done the editor could use  distinct color grading features where one sees the future and two she sees the present momenthowever the performances throughout the film feel lackluster with the actors appearing confused and disengaged this combined with direction that fails to maintain interest or coherence in many scenes significantly undermines the films potentialnegativescinematography cinematography is bad since some pictures dont show a clear image the camera moves so fast that i cannot comprehend the picture i kind of recognized that it tries to initiate the rapidness of the events from the spiders eye point of view but it was a tasteless decision the cinematography is not something like wow the reason why cinematography was lacking is because it was heavily based on medium closeups and dutch tilts which on one hand was a unique choice but on the other hand very hard to watch i found the  degree round camera rotations super cool but again i expected varied distance shots not just medium shots the train scene cinematography was the best in the filmediting and pace the editing is arguably the weakest element of madame web with its rapid cuts and disjointed flow detracting significantly from the storytelling this lack of coherence makes it challenging for the audience to fully engage with the narrativeplot and overall execution the storyline of madame web is cluttered and clichd suffering from a lack of originality and clear direction the films ambition is evident but the execution falls short of creating a compelling narrativethe conclusionmadame web presents a paradoxical experience with exceptional music and sound design standing that sharply contrasts with its various flaws in editing cinematography and directionalthough there are some visually and emotionally stunning moments they are frequently overshadowed by a lack of coherence and clarityalso i think this film would be reasonable and great to be incorporated in a tv series which would have allowed for a more indepth exploration of characters and plotnevertheless madame web is a bit of a mixed bag with moments of potential that ultimately leave the viewer something different visuallyrating ",2024-02-21,NA
"madame web (2024)","a massive waste of time","ethanbresnett","madame web is a new spinoff set in the marvel spiderman world this spinoff is directed partly written and produced by s j clarkson before this film she directed more tv series episodes of superhero shows such as jessica jones and the defenderscassandra webb dakota johnson works as a paramedic in new york and learns after an accident that she has superpowers to see future possibilities she sees that the lives of three girls are threatened by a mysterious masked man with spiderlike powersthis is why she tries to protect the three girls and must convince them that their lives are really in danger to truly protect them they must ensure that the three listen to her and learn to work togetherthe story of this film has an interesting concept but the final story and screenplay were written by five different writers these writers do not always seem to have been on the same page because the story sometimes seems a bit rushed or frayed it sometimes seems as if they didnt really know what exactly to do with it or what the film studio despised of them the screenplay has also been rewritten many times so the cast members could no longer always follow exactly where they were going or supposed to do with the filmdespite these messy rushed aspects the film remains on a familiar predictable side for a superhero film this can make the film seem a bit longwinded or embarrassing the film is reminiscent of other superhero films that came out around the year  but of a somewhat lesser qualitythe visual effects dont always look believable either the blue screen and cgi can be seen in the film for some of the cast members this was also the first time they had actually worked in a film with such visual effects the fact that they have little or no experience with these film situations is sometimes reflected in their actingthe poor script also gives the cast members few opportunities to make something special of their roles dakota johnson also seemed a bit uncomfortable during promotions of the film or ignorant of how to properly promote this film in the final film she tries to make the best of the role and tries to add some comedy to the role but she doesnt always get the chance to do this sydney sweeney isabela merced and celeste oconnor play the three girls cassandra tries to protect all three are given a little time to give their characters some personalities but unfortunately not enough to make you as a viewer really care about the three for a better focused film they might have been better off using a character in the story who cassandra then has to protect tahar rahim plays the villain in the film who tries to kill the three girls but also deals with the poor weak script as a result he does not emerge as strongly as the villain of the story they also didnt incorporate his audio work well into the film because his lips sometimes dont always match what his character is sayingwith all these superhero spinoff films from the sony film studio they only make marvels current film series more messy if sony and disney marvel try to collaborate on the same film series they will have to consult each other more and better and plan where they want to go with this film series",2024-02-20,NA

"constellation (2024)","maybe you dont get it","rlilgeberg","at the end of the first episode i actually thought that i had watched the first two episodes until i checked and saw it was only the first that first one hour episode seriously seemed like two hours of timethe story premise is really compelling and there are bits of story along the way of the first three episodes i watched that really reward you for sticking with it but theres no doubt that either the person who directed the first episodes is trying to mess with the viewers sense of timing or they just dont know how to direct or edit or someone doesntso i kept getting this feeling like why does this seem to constantly be dragging on and on im normally very patient with a good story then in the second episode when jos capsule lands i realized that i spent a full three and a half minutes watching her unbuckle her seat belt and begin to get out of the capsule three and a half minutes thats an eternity for a scene that should have taken maybe a minute max before that scene when shes sending messages to her family that she loves them i noticed it was almost like she was dragging out the lines and repeating feelings two three even four times like it was bizarrely written acted directed or all three i could literally see jo pausing briefly between words seemingly for emotional effect like she was directed to do that there were scenes when jo is reunited with her family where they were so awkwardly long that i found myself wondering if they were acting awkward toward jo or if the scene was just so long that i was reading too much into what i saw in their acting like is alice actually being awkward around jo or is the actress playing alice just standing there trying to act like shes supposed to be standing there staring coollythe other strange part about this show is i had to turn on the english subtitles specifically with closed captioning because there were so many times i wasnt sure if i didnt hear the dialog or if it was just one of the languages i didnt understand and there were no subtitles they flip flop between languages so often like swedish to english to russian to english to swedish to russian etc that it often just doesnt make sense like people dont do this in real life so whats the point i got later on that maybe there is a point of something subtle changing related to languages but it was a whole lot of language immersion for just that one point to be made there were many times when someone is speaking a language that had no english subtitles just speaking russian or speaking swedish like huh why it seemed mostly pointless or maybe the point was the character in the scene does not understand so you feel that by the lack of subtitles or englishand yet this is a good show that i will keep watching by the end ill know for sure whether it was just poor writing and direction or if there was an actual point in the story as a whole im hoping theres a point for all of this weirdness",2024-02-22,NA

"saltburn (2023)","vastly overrated obvious and focused on shock value","brentsbulletinboard","it is  and scholarship student oliver quick has just arrived at oxford he doesnt fit in with the upperclass atmosphere and has no acquaintances after befriending felix catton a popular and wealthy fellow student however oliver finally seems to find his place at the university invited to the catton family home saltburn for the summer holidays oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods nothing is as it seems though as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itselfwritten and directed by emerald fennell saltburn is an initially intriguing though ultimately irritatingly derivative predictable psychological comichorror fennells narrative begins with promise in the first act you arent sure who to trust nor where the story is heading however after the action moves to the manor house saltburn things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films be they the talented mr ripley teorema or the servantthose films examined themes such as class difference obsessiveness personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes never going into them with depth nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions one in particular acts in a violent vacuum of selfobsession and jealously but why what made this character the way they are fennel never bothers to tell us seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the darkmoreover her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches oliver is essentially just a less charismatic scouse tom ripley with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness felix is exactly like ripleys object of obsession dickie greenleaf while his eccentric family are people weve seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy the ruling class among them familiar and lacking in depth fennells characters arent particularly interesting nor is her narrative particularly original further while her dialogue is frequently funny it can also be pretentious particularly during olivers intermittent narrationthroughout the film fennell handles the material with great deference too much one might argue she lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power the ending featuring fullfrontal nudity reminiscent of the music video to liam gallaghers once starring a thankfully clothed eric cantona seems selfindulgent and shall we say cocky furthermore a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy so completely does it abandon realworld logicconversely linus sandgrens glossy cinematography is striking sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles heightening the suspense of the narrative as well as compounding the decadence of the catton family he employs a ratio of  giving the film a topheavy boxedin look making locations feel daunting it is work full of contrast although a cynical critic might suggest an overreliance on cliched visual metaphors such as reflections or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wingshowever sandgrens visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings as does suzie davies rich production design textured and detailed her work fosters a vivid immersive atmosphere which sophie canales costume design and charlotte dirickxs set decoration compounds in addition anthony williss score is stirring his original pieces are seedy and evocative while songs used throughout perhaps most notably sophie ellisbextors murder on the dancefloor complement the narrativebarry keoghan stars as oliver alongside jacob elordi as felix alison oliver as felixs sister venetia and rosamund pike as felixs mother elspeth keoghan is a fascinating actor who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence here however he gives an inconsistent performance when playing oliver as a weird insular personality he shines though when he has to display his dominant side keoghan lacks conviction and doesnt convince an oddly played oddly written nighttime scene with venetia being clearest evidence of thiselordi does much more assured work despite the fact that the character is just a  version of the aforementioned greenleaf he impresses though overcoming the scant characterisation of the role oliver is excellent underplaying the complexities of her character while pike steals the show as the eccentric elspeth richard e grant also stars as felixs father but is criminally underutilised while archie madekwes grating performance as felixs cousin is smug and onenotein conclusion emerald fennells saltburn is a film trying to provoke though isnt as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is though it is funny from time to time and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful the film is ultimately an uneven predictable and derivative affair while the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric the performance of star barry keoghan is inconsistent although rosamund pike is a delight the film around her is not worthy of her talents nor can she save it completely not to rub salt in the wound but this film doesnt burn as brightly as it could have",2023-11-24,NA

itselfwritten and directed by emerald fennell saltburn is an initially intriguing though ultimately irritatingly derivative predictable psychological comichorror fennells narrative begins with promise in the first act you arent sure who to trust nor where the story is heading however after the action moves to the manor house saltburn things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films be they the talented mr ripley teorema or the servantthose films examined themes such as class difference obsessiveness personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes never going into them with depth nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions one in particular acts in a violent vacuum of selfobsession and jealously but why what made this character the way they are fennel never bothers to tell us seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the darkmoreover her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches oliver is essentially just a less charismatic scouse tom ripley with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness felix is exactly like ripleys object of obsession dickie greenleaf while his eccentric family are people weve seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy the ruling class among them familiar and lacking in depth fennells characters arent particularly interesting nor is her narrative particularly original further while her dialogue is frequently funny it can also be pretentious particularly during olivers intermittent narrationthroughout the film fennell handles the material with great deference too much one might argue she lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power the ending featuring fullfrontal nudity reminiscent of the music video to liam gallaghers once starring a thankfully clothed eric cantona seems selfindulgent and shall we say cocky furthermore a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy so completely does it abandon realworld logicconversely linus sandgrens glossy cinematography is striking sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles heightening the suspense of the narrative as well as compounding the decadence of the catton family he employs a ratio of  giving the film a topheavy boxedin look making locations feel daunting it is work full of contrast although a cynical critic might suggest an overreliance on cliched visual metaphors such as reflections or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wingshowever sandgrens visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings as does suzie davies rich production design textured and detailed her work fosters a vivid immersive atmosphere which sophie canales costume design and charlotte dirickxs set decoration compounds in addition anthony williss score is stirring his original pieces are seedy and evocative while songs used throughout perhaps most notably sophie ellisbextors murder on the dancefloor complement the narrativebarry keoghan stars as oliver alongside jacob elordi as felix alison oliver as felixs sister venetia and rosamund pike as felixs mother elspeth keoghan is a fascinating actor who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence here however he gives an inconsistent performance when playing oliver as a weird insular personality he shines though when he has to display his dominant side keoghan lacks conviction and doesnt convince an oddly played oddly written nighttime scene with venetia being clearest evidence of thiselordi does much more assured work despite the fact that the character is just a  version of the aforementioned greenleaf he impresses though overcoming the scant characterisation of the role oliver is excellent underplaying the complexities of her character while pike steals the show as the eccentric elspeth richard e grant also stars as felixs father but is criminally underutilised while archie

"killers of the flower moon (2023)","not the magnificent masterpiece i was hoping for not by far","imseeg","killers of the flower moon is a western crime drama film cowritten and directed by martin scorsese based on the nonfiction book of the same name by david grann starring leonardo dicaprio robert de niro and lily gladstone it touches upon an often overlooked piece of american history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and castin the early s the discovery of oil on land belonging to the native american osage nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world this sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the osage tribe as possible among this group of interlopers is ernest burkhart leonardo dicaprio whom upon arriving in oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle william king hale robert de niro to marry a member of the osage as a way of inheriting their fortune ernest soon falls in love with and later marries mollie lily gladstone a young osage woman who has strong ties to her familys riches as the white occupation of native land continues members of the osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances with some of mollies close family being among the most prominent victimsone of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment they also function as a great method of preservation no matter obscure the topic may be if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream then it has already been permanently preserved in some way this is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time and in doing so has helped maintain its relevance with the general public one event that is often glanced over is the osage indian murders a series of slayings of wealthy members of the native american osage tribe during the early th century however thanks to martin scorseses film killers of the flower moon audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated eyeopening look at americas treatment of one particular group of their indigenous populationmuch like most of scorseses best known work the film is framed as an epic indepth study of the dark side of human nature we watch how the osage tribe who live in harmony among themselves are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land in spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated the osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs because of this the tribes happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination first verbal and then physical it is here we see the sinister plan of william king hale come into play where he marries off his nephew ernest into the osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right what makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it only a filmmaker like scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity and in a style that remains as timeless as everadditionally almost all of scorseses visual trademarks as a director are on full display here from his wideopen cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of s america to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene one in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between ernest and william as they discuss business regarding the osage we see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe with ernest choosing to remain loyal to his osage wife mollie while his uncle william reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place here scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room the darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the osage have created up until this pointdue to the scale of its theme and plotting the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours  minutes in total this is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience while i personally think this made the film more interesting to watch im not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers the films pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air which i believe works rather effectively and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion in other words this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues to that effect scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other hollywood blockbustersin his sixth collaboration with the legendary director leonardo dicaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of ernest burkhart what makes dicaprios character so intriguing is his indecisive nature in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his osage wife mollie on one hand ernests loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncles idea in the first place while on the other hand when he truly falls for mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe dicaprio displays his signature range of emotion here alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncles bidding both of which he pulls off quite effectivelyafter working on ten films together robert de niro steps back from his usual spot as the scorsese lead and into the supporting role as william king hale where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it his intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain with little regard for the wellbeing of others even his nephew what i consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the bible says about spreading the word of god his claim that god wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film a role like this is perfect for an actor like robert de niro and what better director to show this to the world than martin scorsesehowever the films true standout would have to be lily gladstone as mollie who is truly the heart and soul of this story here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life whether its her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives yet despite all these hardships mollie remains as steadfast as

"killers of the flower moon (2023)","not the magnificent masterpiece i was hoping for not by far","imseeg","killers of the flower moon is a western crime drama film cowritten and directed by martin scorsese based on the nonfiction book of the same name by david grann starring leonardo dicaprio robert de niro and lily gladstone it touches upon an often overlooked piece of american history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and castin the early s the discovery of oil on land belonging to the native american osage nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world this sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the osage tribe as possible among this group of interlopers is ernest burkhart leonardo dicaprio whom upon arriving in oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle william king hale robert de niro to marry a member of the osage as a way of inheriting their fortune ernest soon falls in love with and later marries mollie lily gladstone a young osage woman who has strong ties to her familys riches as the white occupation of native land continues members of the osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances with some of mollies close family being among the most prominent victimsone of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment they also function as a great method of preservation no matter obscure the topic may be if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream then it has already been permanently preserved in some way this is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time and in doing so has helped maintain its relevance with the general public one event that is often glanced over is the osage indian murders a series of slayings of wealthy members of the native american osage tribe during the early th century however thanks to martin scorseses film killers of the flower moon audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated eyeopening look at americas treatment of one particular group of their indigenous populationmuch like most of scorseses best known work the film is framed as an epic indepth study of the dark side of human nature we watch how the osage tribe who live in harmony among themselves are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land in spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated the osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs because of this the tribes happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination first verbal and then physical it is here we see the sinister plan of william king hale come into play where he marries off his nephew ernest into the osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right what makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it only a filmmaker like scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity and in a style that remains as timeless as everadditionally almost all of scorseses visual trademarks as a director are on full display here from his wideopen cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of s america to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene one in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between ernest and william as they discuss business regarding the osage we see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe with ernest choosing to remain loyal to his osage wife mollie while his uncle william reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place here scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room the darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the osage have created up until this pointdue to the scale of its theme and plotting the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours  minutes in total this is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience while i personally think this made the film more interesting to watch im not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers the films pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air which i believe works rather effectively and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion in other words this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues to that effect scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other hollywood blockbustersin his sixth collaboration with the legendary director leonardo dicaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of ernest burkhart what makes dicaprios character so intriguing is his indecisive nature in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his osage wife mollie on one hand ernests loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncles idea in the first place while on the other hand when he truly falls for mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe dicaprio displays his signature range of emotion here alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncles bidding both of which he pulls off quite effectivelyafter working on ten films together robert de niro steps back from his usual spot as the scorsese lead and into the supporting role as william king hale where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it his intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain with little regard for the wellbeing of others even his nephew what i consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the bible says about spreading the word of god his claim that god wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film a role like this is perfect for an actor like robert de niro and what better director to show this to the world than martin scorsesehowever the films true standout would have to be lily gladstone as mollie who is truly the heart and soul of this story here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life whether its her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives yet despite all these hardships mollie remains as steadfast as ever choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds and she is among the last of her family who hasnt completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle this is easily a career defining role for gladstone and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one dayfor the american history buff and the martin scorsese fan killers of the flower moon represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds it brings attention to an often neglected historical issue

"killers of the flower moon (2023)","killers of my patience","medjasta","the story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the osage nation for their bountiful oil wealth in s oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until martin scorsese decided to make his killers of the flower moon a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold detached and disarrayed but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some leonardo dicaprio is cast jarringly against type as ernest a cowardly quasi wwii vet who is pressured by his amoral machiavellian uncle king hale robert de niro into marrying wealthy osage woman mollie lily gladstone and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock much of the film is distressing in the sense that we the audience know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with ernest and mollie i saw an interview with scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming backstabbing and psychopathic doublecrossing of his urban crime sagas but in a far wilder more rural and spatially wide open locale he further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way and what that might look like onscreen thematically well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled pun intended machine here because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse its in that second part the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here only lily gladstone who undeniably gives the films best performance is really up to the task imbuing mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant angelic poise that is utterly captivating but shes marooned in a tempest of misguided choices missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis ive read the backstory of this film and how scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the fbis eventual involvement they were ultimately sadly too little too late here and towards a deliberate focus on the osage their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil well he doesnt really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages roundtable elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume there is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that if they could see their enemy they would kill them but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them really from a narrative standpoint its pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them mollie especially look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didnt ring true for me she is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by gladstone but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like ernest rife with red flags from the outset i might add is something that scorsese frustratingly sidesteps stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural i cant help but wonder if this story meant to be told from the perspective of the osage may have been better off in other more edgy and esoteric hands",2023-10-19,NA

"killers of the flower moon (2023)","not the magnificent masterpiece i was hoping for not by far","imseeg","killers of the flower moon is a western crime drama film cowritten and directed by martin scorsese based on the nonfiction book of the same name by david grann starring leonardo dicaprio robert de niro and lily gladstone it touches upon an often overlooked piece of american history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and castin the early s the discovery of oil on land belonging to the native american osage nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world this sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the osage tribe as possible among this group of interlopers is ernest burkhart leonardo dicaprio whom upon arriving in oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle william king hale robert de niro to marry a member of the osage as a way of inheriting their fortune ernest soon falls in love with and later marries mollie lily gladstone a young osage woman who has strong ties to her familys riches as the white occupation of native land continues members of the osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances with some of mollies close family being among the most prominent victimsone of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment they also function as a great method of preservation no matter obscure the topic may be if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream then it has already been permanently preserved in some way this is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time and in doing so has helped maintain its relevance with the general public one event that is often glanced over is the osage indian murders a series of slayings of wealthy members of the native american osage tribe during the early th century however thanks to martin scorseses film killers of the flower moon audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated eyeopening look at americas treatment of one particular group of their indigenous populationmuch like most of scorseses best known work the film is framed as an epic indepth study of the dark side of human nature we watch how the osage tribe who live in harmony among themselves are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land in spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated the osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs because of this the tribes happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination first verbal and then physical it is here we see the sinister plan of william king hale come into play where he marries off his nephew ernest into the osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right what makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it only a filmmaker like scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity and in a style that remains as timeless as everadditionally almost all of scorseses visual trademarks as a director are on full display here from his wideopen cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of s america to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene one in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between ernest and william as they discuss business regarding the osage we see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe with ernest choosing to remain loyal to his osage wife mollie while his uncle william reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place here scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room the darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the osage have created up until this pointdue to the scale of its theme and plotting the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours  minutes in total this is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience while i personally think this made the film more interesting to watch im not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers the films pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air which i believe works rather effectively and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion in other words this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues to that effect scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other hollywood blockbustersin his sixth collaboration with the legendary director leonardo dicaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of ernest burkhart what makes dicaprios character so intriguing is his indecisive nature in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his osage wife mollie on one hand ernests loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncles idea in the first place while on the other hand when he truly falls for mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe dicaprio displays his signature range of emotion here alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncles bidding both of which he pulls off quite effectivelyafter working on ten films together robert de niro steps back from his usual spot as the scorsese lead and into the supporting role as william king hale where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it his intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain with little regard for the wellbeing of others even his nephew what i consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the bible says about spreading the word of god his claim that god wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film a role like this is perfect for an actor like robert de niro and what better director to show this to the world than martin scorsesehowever the films true standout would have to be lily gladstone as mollie who is truly the heart and soul of this story here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life whether its her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives yet despite all these hardships mollie remains as steadfast as ever choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds and she is among the last of her family who hasnt completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle this is easily a career defining role for gladstone and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one dayfor the american history buff and the martin scorsese fan killers of the flower moon represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds it brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another wellcrafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veterans library as mentioned previously it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period after all as the classic saying goes  those who dont learn from history are doomed to repeat iti rate it a solid ",2023-10-19,NA

long runtimes epics like lawrence of arabia or das boot are both over three hours in length and rocket along at a brisk pace largely because of fastidious editing the duration of both those pictures is necessary one could argue to tell their stories without sacrificing details coherence or excitement then there are films like heavens gate which also has a runtime of over three hours and is a bloated selfindulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director michael ciminos arrogant refusal to cut anythingmartin scorseses killers of the flower moon teeters somewhere between both camps it has elements deserving of high praise but is inarguably too long with pacing structural and narrative issues galore based on the nonfiction novel of the same name by david grann the film centers on emmet burkhart a simpleminded world war i veteran who returns to the osage nation to the home of his uncle william king hale there emmet falls for an osage named mollie who his uncle tells him is set to inherit much of her peoples oil headrights meanwhile someone is killing off the wealthy osage in the area and it looks like mollies family might be nexton paper it sounds like a fascinating exciting picture with dashes of psychological intrigue however scorseses version of the tale is dour swollen and predictable granns riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed lacking any kind of suspense or momentum screenwriters scorsese and eric roth cram too much into the narrative namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa they have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly which they dont do preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play outhad scorsese and longtime collaborator thelma schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth things could have been different there are some brilliant sequences in the movie in fact the first third is engaging and intriguing the mystery is successfully set up the location established and the characters introduced then things start going downhill the pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime until the end of course when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion beyond pacing there are some fundamental flaws editingwise that are inexplicable considering scorsese and schoonmakers prestigefor example seemingly important characters are introduced then disappear for long stretches of time similarly the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times or overlooked leaving us in the dark furthermore at times cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak all this including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative is amateur work far below scorsese and schoonmakers levelthis is not to say however that killers of the flower moon is without redeeming elements to make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation no matter its effectiveness scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the osage people the film doesnt explore the historical or cultural context of the osage nation nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivorsscorsese and roths narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the osage or the systemic injustice that they face their characterisation lacks depth or nuance relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes had he focused on the perspective and agency of the osage rather than the corrupt inept white characters scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his handsconversely rodrigo prietos cinematography is evocative and enchanting it makes for a stunning watch proving scorseses eye for visuals has not been blinded under scorseses direction prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the oklahoma landscape astutely while jack fisks detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness which adam williss set decoration and jacqueline wests costume design only compoundsmoreover the late great robbie robertsons score is striking bearing a resemblance to the work of ry cooder full of sleazy slide guitars and indian chants it complements the narrative perfectly the inclusion of periodaccurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism which in the times of baz luhrmann who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces is most welcome the last project robertson worked on before his death his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansongleonardo dicaprio stars as emmet alongside lily gladstone as mollie and robert deniro as king hale dicaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances but here takes a page out of the daniel day lewis playbook the most intense acting must surely be the best dicaprio spends the whole film frowning scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his characters expressions and eccentricities in the first third he has a bit of range though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performanceas does lily gladstone initially she creates in mollie a nuanced and witty character who can see through people she doesnt suffer fools and we find her both compelling and captivating however after the first third of the film she becomes subservient unquestioning and dull and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being shall we say slowed down deniro for his part plays king hale like an evil george burns manipulative darkly funny and morally bereft anytime hes on screen the film is a joy hes the best thing about itthey are supported by a large cast of talented actors some of whom do great work ty mitchell is excellent as john a poor man drawn into emmet and king hales plans who has more dignity then the both of them combined jesse plemons does typically fine work as fbi man tom white while louis cancelmi is seedily slick as kelsie morrison a stooge of king hales on the other hand the likes of cara jade myers as mollies alcoholic sister and brendan fraser in a thankfully small role as king hales lawyer are both so miscast and over the top they distract from everything going on around themits a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a dean martin song the money song from  them that have it get more of it the less they need it the more they love it such is the thesis of the film greed spreads like a plague and the richer you are the greedier you are its not original nor is it profound this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in

"killers of the flower moon (2023)","not the magnificent masterpiece i was hoping for not by far","imseeg","killers of the flower moon is a western crime drama film cowritten and directed by martin scorsese based on the nonfiction book of the same name by david grann starring leonardo dicaprio robert de niro and lily gladstone it touches upon an often overlooked piece of american history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and castin the early s the discovery of oil on land belonging to the native american osage nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world this sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the osage tribe as possible among this group of interlopers is ernest burkhart leonardo dicaprio whom upon arriving in oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle william king hale robert de niro to marry a member of the osage as a way of inheriting their fortune ernest soon falls in love with and later marries mollie lily gladstone a young osage woman who has strong ties to her familys riches as the white occupation of native land continues members of the osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances with some of mollies close family being among the most prominent victimsone of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment they also function as a great method of preservation no matter obscure the topic may be if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream then it has already been permanently preserved in some way this is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time and in doing so has helped maintain its relevance with the general public one event that is often glanced over is the osage indian murders a series of slayings of wealthy members of the native american osage tribe during the early th century however thanks to martin scorseses film killers of the flower moon audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated eyeopening look at americas treatment of one particular group of their indigenous populationmuch like most of scorseses best known work the film is framed as an epic indepth study of the dark side of human nature we watch how the osage tribe who live in harmony among themselves are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land in spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated the osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs because of this the tribes happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination first verbal and then physical it is here we see the sinister plan of william king hale come into play where he marries off his nephew ernest into the osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right what makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it only a filmmaker like scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity and in a style that remains as timeless as everadditionally almost all of scorseses visual trademarks as a director are on full display here from his wideopen cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of s america to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene one in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between ernest and william as they discuss business regarding the osage we see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe with ernest choosing to remain loyal to his osage wife mollie while his uncle william reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place here scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room the darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the osage have created up until this pointdue to the scale of its theme and plotting the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours  minutes in total this is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience while i personally think this made the film more interesting to watch im not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers the films pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air which i believe works rather effectively and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion in other words this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues to that effect scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other hollywood blockbustersin his sixth collaboration with the legendary director leonardo dicaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of ernest burkhart what makes dicaprios character so intriguing is his indecisive nature in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his osage wife mollie on one hand ernests loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncles idea in the first place while on the other hand when he truly falls for mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe dicaprio displays his signature range of emotion here alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncles bidding both of which he pulls off quite effectivelyafter working on ten films together robert de niro steps back from his usual spot as the scorsese lead and into the supporting role as william king hale where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it his intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain with little regard for the wellbeing of others even his nephew what i consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the bible says about spreading the word of god his claim that god wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film a role like this is perfect for an actor like robert de niro and what better director to show this to the world than martin scorsesehowever the films true standout would have to be lily gladstone as mollie who is truly the heart and soul of this story here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life whether its her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives yet despite all these hardships mollie remains as steadfast as ever choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds and she is among the last of her family who hasnt completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle this is easily a career defining role for gladstone and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one dayfor the american history buff and the martin scorsese fan killers of the flower moon represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds it brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another wellcrafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veterans library as mentioned previously it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period after all as the classic saying goes  those who dont learn from history are doomed to repeat iti rate it a solid ",2023-10-19,NA

long runtimes epics like lawrence of arabia or das boot are both over three hours in length and rocket along at a brisk pace largely because of fastidious editing the duration of both those pictures is necessary one could argue to tell their stories without sacrificing details coherence or excitement then there are films like heavens gate which also has a runtime of over three hours and is a bloated selfindulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director michael ciminos arrogant refusal to cut anythingmartin scorseses killers of the flower moon teeters somewhere between both camps it has elements deserving of high praise but is inarguably too long with pacing structural and narrative issues galore based on the nonfiction novel of the same name by david grann the film centers on emmet burkhart a simpleminded world war i veteran who returns to the osage nation to the home of his uncle william king hale there emmet falls for an osage named mollie who his uncle tells him is set to inherit much of her peoples oil headrights meanwhile someone is killing off the wealthy osage in the area and it looks like mollies family might be nexton paper it sounds like a fascinating exciting picture with dashes of psychological intrigue however scorseses version of the tale is dour swollen and predictable granns riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed lacking any kind of suspense or momentum screenwriters scorsese and eric roth cram too much into the narrative namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa they have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly which they dont do preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play outhad scorsese and longtime collaborator thelma schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth things could have been different there are some brilliant sequences in the movie in fact the first third is engaging and intriguing the mystery is successfully set up the location established and the characters introduced then things start going downhill the pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime until the end of course when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion beyond pacing there are some fundamental flaws editingwise that are inexplicable considering scorsese and schoonmakers prestigefor example seemingly important characters are introduced then disappear for long stretches of time similarly the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times or overlooked leaving us in the dark furthermore at times cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak all this including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative is amateur work far below scorsese and schoonmakers levelthis is not to say however that killers of the flower moon is without redeeming elements to make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation no matter its effectiveness scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the osage people the film doesnt explore the historical or cultural context of the osage nation nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivorsscorsese and roths narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the osage or the systemic injustice that they face their characterisation lacks depth or nuance relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes had he focused on the perspective and agency of the osage rather than the corrupt inept white characters scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his handsconversely rodrigo prietos cinematography is evocative and enchanting it makes for a stunning watch proving scorseses eye for visuals has not been blinded under scorseses direction prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the oklahoma landscape astutely while jack fisks detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness which adam williss set decoration and jacqueline wests costume design only compoundsmoreover the late great robbie robertsons score is striking bearing a resemblance to the work of ry cooder full of sleazy slide guitars and indian chants it complements the narrative perfectly the inclusion of periodaccurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism which in the times of baz luhrmann who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces is most welcome the last project robertson worked on before his death his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansongleonardo dicaprio stars as emmet alongside lily gladstone as mollie and robert deniro as king hale dicaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances but here takes a page out of the daniel day lewis playbook the most intense acting must surely be the best dicaprio spends the whole film frowning scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his characters expressions and eccentricities in the first third he has a bit of range though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performanceas does lily gladstone initially she creates in mollie a nuanced and witty character who can see through people she doesnt suffer fools and we find her both compelling and captivating however after the first third of the film she becomes subservient unquestioning and dull and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being shall we say slowed down deniro for his part plays king hale like an evil george burns manipulative darkly funny and morally bereft anytime hes on screen the film is a joy hes the best thing about itthey are supported by a large cast of talented actors some of whom do great work ty mitchell is excellent as john a poor man drawn into emmet and king hales plans who has more dignity then the both of them combined jesse plemons does typically fine work as fbi man tom white while louis cancelmi is seedily slick as kelsie morrison a stooge of king hales on the other hand the likes of cara jade myers as mollies alcoholic sister and brendan fraser in a thankfully small role as king hales lawyer are both so miscast and over the top they distract from everything going on around themits a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a dean martin song the money song from  them that have it get more of it the less they need it the more they love it such is the thesis of the film greed spreads like a plague and the richer you are the greedier you are its not original nor is it profound this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in  in mervyn leroys the fbi storyat the end of the day killers of the flower moon is a truncated adaptation of a great nonfiction book overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message despite

"killers of the flower moon (2023)","not the magnificent masterpiece i was hoping for not by far","imseeg","killers of the flower moon is a western crime drama film cowritten and directed by martin scorsese based on the nonfiction book of the same name by david grann starring leonardo dicaprio robert de niro and lily gladstone it touches upon an often overlooked piece of american history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and castin the early s the discovery of oil on land belonging to the native american osage nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world this sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the osage tribe as possible among this group of interlopers is ernest burkhart leonardo dicaprio whom upon arriving in oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle william king hale robert de niro to marry a member of the osage as a way of inheriting their fortune ernest soon falls in love with and later marries mollie lily gladstone a young osage woman who has strong ties to her familys riches as the white occupation of native land continues members of the osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances with some of mollies close family being among the most prominent victimsone of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment they also function as a great method of preservation no matter obscure the topic may be if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream then it has already been permanently preserved in some way this is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time and in doing so has helped maintain its relevance with the general public one event that is often glanced over is the osage indian murders a series of slayings of wealthy members of the native american osage tribe during the early th century however thanks to martin scorseses film killers of the flower moon audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated eyeopening look at americas treatment of one particular group of their indigenous populationmuch like most of scorseses best known work the film is framed as an epic indepth study of the dark side of human nature we watch how the osage tribe who live in harmony among themselves are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land in spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated the osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs because of this the tribes happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination first verbal and then physical it is here we see the sinister plan of william king hale come into play where he marries off his nephew ernest into the osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right what makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it only a filmmaker like scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity and in a style that remains as timeless as everadditionally almost all of scorseses visual trademarks as a director are on full display here from his wideopen cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of s america to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene one in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between ernest and william as they discuss business regarding the osage we see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe with ernest choosing to remain loyal to his osage wife mollie while his uncle william reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place here scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room the darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the osage have created up until this pointdue to the scale of its theme and plotting the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours  minutes in total this is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience while i personally think this made the film more interesting to watch im not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers the films pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air which i believe works rather effectively and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion in other words this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues to that effect scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other hollywood blockbustersin his sixth collaboration with the legendary director leonardo dicaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of ernest burkhart what makes dicaprios character so intriguing is his indecisive nature in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his osage wife mollie on one hand ernests loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncles idea in the first place while on the other hand when he truly falls for mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe dicaprio displays his signature range of emotion here alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncles bidding both of which he pulls off quite effectivelyafter working on ten films together robert de niro steps back from his usual spot as the scorsese lead and into the supporting role as william king hale where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it his intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain with little regard for the wellbeing of others even his nephew what i consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the bible says about spreading the word of god his claim that god wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film a role like this is perfect for an actor like robert de niro and what better director to show this to the world than martin scorsesehowever the films true standout would have to be lily gladstone as mollie who is truly the heart and soul of this story here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life whether its her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives yet despite all these hardships mollie remains as steadfast as ever choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds and she is among the last of her family who hasnt completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle this is easily a career defining role for gladstone and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one dayfor the american history buff and the martin scorsese fan killers of the flower moon represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds it brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another wellcrafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veterans library as mentioned previously it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period after all as the classic saying goes  those who dont learn from history are doomed to repeat iti rate it a solid ",2023-10-19,NA

long runtimes epics like lawrence of arabia or das boot are both over three hours in length and rocket along at a brisk pace largely because of fastidious editing the duration of both those pictures is necessary one could argue to tell their stories without sacrificing details coherence or excitement then there are films like heavens gate which also has a runtime of over three hours and is a bloated selfindulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director michael ciminos arrogant refusal to cut anythingmartin scorseses killers of the flower moon teeters somewhere between both camps it has elements deserving of high praise but is inarguably too long with pacing structural and narrative issues galore based on the nonfiction novel of the same name by david grann the film centers on emmet burkhart a simpleminded world war i veteran who returns to the osage nation to the home of his uncle william king hale there emmet falls for an osage named mollie who his uncle tells him is set to inherit much of her peoples oil headrights meanwhile someone is killing off the wealthy osage in the area and it looks like mollies family might be nexton paper it sounds like a fascinating exciting picture with dashes of psychological intrigue however scorseses version of the tale is dour swollen and predictable granns riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed lacking any kind of suspense or momentum screenwriters scorsese and eric roth cram too much into the narrative namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa they have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly which they dont do preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play outhad scorsese and longtime collaborator thelma schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth things could have been different there are some brilliant sequences in the movie in fact the first third is engaging and intriguing the mystery is successfully set up the location established and the characters introduced then things start going downhill the pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime until the end of course when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion beyond pacing there are some fundamental flaws editingwise that are inexplicable considering scorsese and schoonmakers prestigefor example seemingly important characters are introduced then disappear for long stretches of time similarly the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times or overlooked leaving us in the dark furthermore at times cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak all this including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative is amateur work far below scorsese and schoonmakers levelthis is not to say however that killers of the flower moon is without redeeming elements to make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation no matter its effectiveness scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the osage people the film doesnt explore the historical or cultural context of the osage nation nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivorsscorsese and roths narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the osage or the systemic injustice that they face their characterisation lacks depth or nuance relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes had he focused on the perspective and agency of the osage rather than the corrupt inept white characters scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his handsconversely rodrigo prietos cinematography is evocative and enchanting it makes for a stunning watch proving scorseses eye for visuals has not been blinded under scorseses direction prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the oklahoma landscape astutely while jack fisks detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness which adam williss set decoration and jacqueline wests costume design only compoundsmoreover the late great robbie robertsons score is striking bearing a resemblance to the work of ry cooder full of sleazy slide guitars and indian chants it complements the narrative perfectly the inclusion of periodaccurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism which in the times of baz luhrmann who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces is most welcome the last project robertson worked on before his death his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansongleonardo dicaprio stars as emmet alongside lily gladstone as mollie and robert deniro as king hale dicaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances but here takes a page out of the daniel day lewis playbook the most intense acting must surely be the best dicaprio spends the whole film frowning scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his characters expressions and eccentricities in the first third he has a bit of range though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performanceas does lily gladstone initially she creates in mollie a nuanced and witty character who can see through people she doesnt suffer fools and we find her both compelling and captivating however after the first third of the film she becomes subservient unquestioning and dull and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being shall we say slowed down deniro for his part plays king hale like an evil george burns manipulative darkly funny and morally bereft anytime hes on screen the film is a joy hes the best thing about itthey are supported by a large cast of talented actors some of whom do great work ty mitchell is excellent as john a poor man drawn into emmet and king hales plans who has more dignity then the both of them combined jesse plemons does typically fine work as fbi man tom white while louis cancelmi is seedily slick as kelsie morrison a stooge of king hales on the other hand the likes of cara jade myers as mollies alcoholic sister and brendan fraser in a thankfully small role as king hales lawyer are both so miscast and over the top they distract from everything going on around themits a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a dean martin song the money song from  them that have it get more of it the less they need it the more they love it such is the thesis of the film greed spreads like a plague and the richer you are the greedier you are its not original nor is it profound this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in  in mervyn leroys the fbi storyat the end of the day killers of the flower moon is a truncated adaptation of a great nonfiction book overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message despite its stellar cinematography evocative score and a few powerful performances martin scorseses killers of the flower moon is an underwhelming disappointment",2023-10-22,NA

"american fiction (2023)","american fiction is a smart and wellcrafted film an absolute mustsee","kevinrobbins","american fiction is a comedy drama film written and directed by cord jefferson based on the novel erasure by percival everett starring jeffrey wright in the lead role it stands as one of the best written most damning satires about racial stereotypes to hit movie screens in a very long timein los angeles literature professor thelonious monk ellison jeffrey wright is placed on mandatory leave by his university after frequently arguing with his students over differing opinions on racial issues wishing to spend this time off with his family monk travels to boston to meet up with them and later decides to attend a literary seminar taking place nearby monks qa panel receives very little attention due to most of the attendees choosing instead to watch an onstage interview with author sintara golden issa rae whose novel wes lives in da ghetto has become a number one bestseller surprised at how much sintaras book panders to african american stereotypes yet receives such glowing praise from readers monk decides to write his own novel in the exact same style titling it my pafology and loading it up with every cliche imaginable for a black writer under the pen name stagg r leigh monk sends his completed novel to various publishers out of spite and is soon shocked to discover that he is now being offered  and a movie deal for the rights to his storyit can be difficult for creative people to compromise their vision for the sake of pandering to others all too often many writers artists performers and other similar folk are at the mercy of company executives forcing them to make changes to their work as a result of wishing to keep up with the times of course this can yield mixed results as while the creators in question will likely profit greatly from their amended product a major part of their true selves may have been severely altered in the process this is especially the case with the current political climate with many people being forcibly made to acquiesce to modern views on race sexuality and gender identity whether they agree with any of it or not the film american fiction is an excellent example of how it is possible to satirise the worlds view on stereotypes without once resorting to sensationalism or condescensionfrom the very opening scene you can immediately tell what direction this movie is going to take with its satirical point of view we watch as monk a well educated african american university scholar has an argument with one of his white female students regarding the title of a book he is teaching the class the book in question whose title contains a racial slur offends the young student with hair dyed neon green prompting her to question why he isnt offended along with her monk tells the student that if he is capable of understanding the proper context of what is being taught then she can as well which he soon learns the hard way is not the case at all the scathing yet humorous look at the way modern teachers have to deal with these types of students especially from an african american perspective is one of the many reasons this movie works as well as it does this is because it allows the audience to see the hypocrisy of virtue signalling which calls attention to the subconscious racism on display by the very ones who claim to be against itlater on when monk writes his book we watch as he dumbs down every element of his otherwise intelligent storytelling technique gone is his sophisticated writing style and in its place is the stereotypical african american street vernacular spoken by violent gunwielding criminals as the main characters coming from a man with such a highly educated background it becomes obvious to the viewer that it is a painful experience for monk to compromise what could have been a clever indepth story about two black friends but he forcefully presses on to prove his point about pandering to his surprise monks experiment works a little too well and he finds himself offered a large sum of money just for the publishing rights alone on that note perhaps the best way to describe this film is that its like a combination of mel brookss the producers and spike lees blackkklansman as each involve some kind of deceptive plan that goes horribly right for the protagonistin addition to the sharply satirical humour woven throughout the story the film also has its fair share of deeply emotional moments primarily shown through members of monks immediate family although it is shown that monk had a respectable upbringing his family has still been subjected to various ups and downs that have essentially shaped him into the person he is today for instance his mother agnes leslie uggams suffers from early stages of alzheimers disease causing her to forget most of the great achievements he and his other siblings have accomplished throughout their lives because of this monk is forced into an ultimatum move her into an expensive nursing home with his own money or let his siblings sort things out for a cheaper pricealso monks estranged brother cliff sterling k brown has been living a hedonistic lifestyle after divorcing his wife frequently engaging in drug use and sexual encounters we later see that cliff whose divorce was the result of him coming out as gay is now at odds with agnes due to her homophobic views on family values putting a strain on his relationship with her i was highly impressed with the way director cord jefferson was able to juggle all of monks family issues so smoothly while simultaneously keeping the core satirical elements at the forefront of the story most first time filmmakers would greatly falter in this department but jefferson strikes the perfect balance between darkly comical and touchingly dramatic without ever using cheap jokes or unearned sentimentality to get the point acrossin his best film performance to date jeffrey wright does a fantastic job in the role of monk several times throughout the film we witness monk react to all of the bizarre sometimes frustrating things that end up happening to him and wrights facial expressions and body language certainly shine during these scenes in the previously mentioned opening its easy to understand how irritated monk must be at dealing with socially ignorant people like his offended student and the repressed annoyance he shows is both funny and relatable just by the level of self control he has during this situation ive always found wright to be an underrated actor who has never become a household name despite starring in several on screen productions over the years so its nice to see him finally receive some mainstream acknowledgement for his work in this filmworth mentioning as well is sterling k brown as cliff monks estranged homosexual younger brother what i liked most about cliff as a character is the way in which he acts as a reminder to monk of the importance of staying true to himself in one scene which i wont discuss in too much detail due to spoilers we see cliff and monk talking about the long term impact of doing things to appease others rather than yourself this introspective chat about living life your own way is among the most emotionally affecting parts of the film and brown definitely holds his own alongside wright during this particular moment you are really given the sense that these two brothers now share a common ground despite all of their past disagreementstaking into account its timely subject matter cord jeffersons american fiction stands triumphantly as one of the cleverest funniest satirical films to be released in many years its so rare to see a brand new filmmaker get everything right on their first try while at the same time create something that has the potential to be a talking point for generations to come of course jefferson could not have accomplished any of this without the help of the films cast whom he has given them all great material to work with thanks to his excellent screenplay with all that said jefferson has now established himself as a filmmaker to watch and i eagerly await any future projects he may have on the horizoni rate it a very high ",2024-02-08,NA

discover that he is now being offered  and a movie deal for the rights to his storyit can be difficult for creative people to compromise their vision for the sake of pandering to others all too often many writers artists performers and other similar folk are at the mercy of company executives forcing them to make changes to their work as a result of wishing to keep up with the times of course this can yield mixed results as while the creators in question will likely profit greatly from their amended product a major part of their true selves may have been severely altered in the process this is

racial issues wishing to spend this time off with his family monk travels to boston to meet up with them and later decides to attend a literary seminar taking place nearby monks qa panel receives very little attention due to most of the attendees choosing instead to watch an onstage interview with author sintara golden issa rae whose novel wes lives in da ghetto has become a number one bestseller surprised at how much sintaras book panders to african american stereotypes yet receives such glowing praise from readers monk decides to write his own novel in the exact same style titling it my pafology and loading it up with every cliche imaginable for a black writer under the pen name stagg r leigh monk sends his completed novel to various publishers out of spite and is soon shocked to discover that he is now being offered  and a movie deal for the rights to his storyit can be difficult for creative people to compromise their vision for the sake of pandering to others all too often many writers artists performers and other similar folk are at the mercy of company executives forcing them to make changes to their work as a result of wishing to keep up with the times of course this can yield mixed results as while the creators in question will likely profit greatly from their amended product a major part of their true selves may have been severely altered in the process this is especially the case with the current political climate with many people being forcibly made to acquiesce to modern views on race sexuality and gender identity whether they agree with any of it or not the film american fiction is an excellent example of how it is possible to satirise the worlds view on stereotypes without once resorting to sensationalism or condescensionfrom the very opening scene you can immediately tell what direction this movie is going to take with its satirical point of view we watch as monk a well educated african american university scholar has an argument with one of his white female students regarding the title of a book he is teaching the class the book in question whose title contains a racial slur offends the young student with hair dyed neon green prompting her to question why he isnt offended along with her monk tells the student that if he is capable of understanding the proper context of what is being taught then she can as well which he soon learns the hard way is not the case at all the scathing yet humorous look at the way modern teachers have to deal with these types of students especially from an african american perspective is one of the many reasons this movie works as well as it does this is because it allows the audience to see the hypocrisy of virtue signalling which calls attention to the subconscious racism on display by the very ones who claim to be against itlater on when monk writes his book we watch as he dumbs down every element of his otherwise intelligent storytelling technique gone is his sophisticated writing style and in its place is the stereotypical african american street vernacular spoken by violent gunwielding criminals as the main characters coming from a man with such a highly educated background it becomes obvious to the viewer that it is a painful experience for monk to compromise what could have been a clever indepth story about two black friends but he forcefully presses on to prove his point about pandering to his surprise monks experiment works a little too well and he finds himself offered a large sum of money just for the publishing rights alone on that note perhaps the best way to describe this film is that its like a combination of mel brookss the producers and spike lees blackkklansman as each involve some kind of deceptive plan that goes horribly right for the protagonistin addition to the sharply satirical humour woven throughout the story the film also has its fair share of deeply emotional moments primarily shown through members of monks immediate family although it is shown that monk had a respectable upbringing his family has still been subjected to various ups and downs that have essentially shaped him into the person he is today for instance his mother agnes leslie uggams suffers from early stages of alzheimers disease causing her to forget most of the great achievements he and his other siblings have accomplished throughout their lives because of this monk is forced into an ultimatum move her into an expensive nursing home with his own money or let his siblings sort things out for a cheaper pricealso monks estranged brother cliff sterling k brown has been living a hedonistic lifestyle after divorcing his wife frequently engaging in drug use and sexual encounters we later see that cliff whose divorce was the result of him coming out as gay is now at odds with agnes due to her homophobic views on family values putting a strain on his relationship with her i was highly impressed with the way director cord jefferson was able to juggle all of monks family issues so smoothly while simultaneously keeping the core satirical elements at the forefront of the story most first time filmmakers would greatly falter in this department but jefferson strikes the perfect balance between darkly comical and touchingly dramatic without ever using cheap jokes or unearned sentimentality to get the point acrossin his best film performance to date jeffrey wright does a fantastic job in the role of monk several times throughout the film we witness monk react to all of the bizarre sometimes frustrating things that end up happening to him and wrights facial expressions and body language certainly shine during these scenes in the previously mentioned opening its easy to understand how irritated monk must be at dealing with socially ignorant people like his offended student and the repressed annoyance he shows is both funny and relatable just by the level of self control he has during this situation ive always found wright to be an underrated actor who has never become a household name despite starring in several on screen productions over the years so its nice to see him finally receive some mainstream acknowledgement for his work in this filmworth mentioning as well is sterling k brown as cliff monks estranged homosexual younger brother what i liked most about cliff as a character is the way in which he acts as a reminder to monk of the importance of staying true to himself in one scene which i wont discuss in too much detail due to spoilers we see cliff and monk talking about the long term impact of doing things to appease others rather than yourself this introspective chat about living life your own way is among the most emotionally affecting parts of the film and brown definitely holds his own alongside wright during this particular moment you are really given the sense that these two brothers now share a common ground despite all of their past disagreementstaking into account its timely subject matter cord jeffersons american fiction stands triumphantly as one of the cleverest funniest satirical films to be released in many years its so rare to see a brand new filmmaker get everything right on their first try while at the same time create something that has the potential to be a talking point for generations to come of course jefferson could not have accomplished any of this without the help of the films cast whom he has given them all great material to work with thanks to his excellent screenplay with all that said jefferson has now established himself as a

"american fiction (2023)","american fiction is a smart and wellcrafted film an absolute mustsee","kevinrobbins","american fiction is a comedy drama film written and directed by cord jefferson based on the novel erasure by percival everett starring jeffrey wright in the lead role it stands as one of the best written most damning satires about racial stereotypes to hit movie screens in a very long timein los angeles literature professor thelonious monk ellison jeffrey wright is placed on mandatory leave by his university after frequently arguing with his students over differing opinions on racial issues wishing to spend this time off with his family monk travels to boston to meet up with them and later decides to attend a literary seminar taking place nearby monks qa panel receives very little attention due to most of the attendees choosing instead to watch an onstage interview with author sintara golden issa rae whose novel wes lives in da ghetto has become a number one bestseller surprised at how much sintaras book panders to african american stereotypes yet receives such glowing praise from readers monk decides to write his own novel in the exact same style titling it my pafology and loading it up with every cliche imaginable for a black writer under the pen name stagg r leigh monk sends his completed novel to various publishers out of spite and is soon shocked to discover that he is now being offered  and a movie deal for the rights to his storyit can be difficult for creative people to compromise their vision for the sake of pandering to others all too often many writers artists performers and other similar folk are at the mercy of company executives forcing them to make changes to their work as a result of wishing to keep up with the times of course this can yield mixed results as while the creators in question will likely profit greatly from their amended product a major part of their true selves may have been severely altered in the process this is especially the case with the current political climate with many people being forcibly made to acquiesce to modern views on race sexuality and gender identity whether they agree with any of it or not the film american fiction is an excellent example of how it is possible to satirise the worlds view on stereotypes without once resorting to sensationalism or condescensionfrom the very opening scene you can immediately tell what direction this movie is going to take with its satirical point of view we watch as monk a well educated african american university scholar has an argument with one of his white female students regarding the title of a book he is teaching the class the book in question whose title contains a racial slur offends the young student with hair dyed neon green prompting her to question why he isnt offended along with her monk tells the student that if he is capable of understanding the proper context of what is being taught then she can as well which he soon learns the hard way is not the case at all the scathing yet humorous look at the way modern teachers have to deal with these types of students especially from an african american perspective is one of the many reasons this movie works as well as it does this is because it allows the audience to see the hypocrisy of virtue signalling which calls attention to the subconscious racism on display by the very ones who claim to be against itlater on when monk writes his book we watch as he dumbs down every element of his otherwise intelligent storytelling technique gone is his sophisticated writing style and in its place is the stereotypical african american street vernacular spoken by violent gunwielding criminals as the main characters coming from a man with such a highly educated background it becomes obvious to the viewer that it is a painful experience for monk to compromise what could have been a clever indepth story about two black friends but he forcefully presses on to prove his point about pandering to his surprise monks experiment works a little too well and he finds himself offered a large sum of money just for the publishing rights alone on that note perhaps the best way to describe this film is that its like a combination of mel brookss the producers and spike lees blackkklansman as each involve some kind of deceptive plan that goes horribly right for the protagonistin addition to the sharply satirical humour woven throughout the story the film also has its fair share of deeply emotional moments primarily shown through members of monks immediate family although it is shown that monk had a respectable upbringing his family has still been subjected to various ups and downs that have essentially shaped him into the person he is today for instance his mother agnes leslie uggams suffers from early stages of alzheimers disease causing her to forget most of the great achievements he and his other siblings have accomplished throughout their lives because of this monk is forced into an ultimatum move her into an expensive nursing home with his own money or let his siblings sort things out for a cheaper pricealso monks estranged brother cliff sterling k brown has been living a hedonistic lifestyle after divorcing his wife frequently engaging in drug use and sexual encounters we later see that cliff whose divorce was the result of him coming out as gay is now at odds with agnes due to her homophobic views on family values putting a strain on his relationship with her i was highly impressed with the way director cord jefferson was able to juggle all of monks family issues so smoothly while simultaneously keeping the core satirical elements at the forefront of the story most first time filmmakers would greatly falter in this department but jefferson strikes the perfect balance between darkly comical and touchingly dramatic without ever using cheap jokes or unearned sentimentality to get the point acrossin his best film performance to date jeffrey wright does a fantastic job in the role of monk several times throughout the film we witness monk react to all of the bizarre sometimes frustrating things that end up happening to him and wrights facial expressions and body language certainly shine during these scenes in the previously mentioned opening its easy to understand how irritated monk must be at dealing with socially ignorant people like his offended student and the repressed annoyance he shows is both funny and relatable just by the level of self control he has during this situation ive always found wright to be an underrated actor who has never become a household name despite starring in several on screen productions over the years so its nice to see him finally receive some mainstream acknowledgement for his work in this filmworth mentioning as well is sterling k brown as cliff monks estranged homosexual younger brother what i liked most about cliff as a character is the way in which he acts as a reminder to monk of the importance of staying true to himself in one scene which i wont discuss in too much detail due to spoilers we see cliff and monk talking about the long term impact of doing things to appease others rather than yourself this introspective chat about living life your own way is among the most emotionally affecting parts of the film and brown definitely holds his own alongside wright during this particular moment you are really given the sense that these two brothers now share a common ground despite all of their past disagreementstaking into account its timely subject matter cord jeffersons american fiction stands triumphantly as one of the cleverest funniest satirical films to be released in many years its so rare to see a brand new filmmaker get everything right on their first try while at the same time create something that has the potential to be a talking point for generations to come of course jefferson could not have accomplished any of this without the help of the films cast whom he has given them all great material to work with thanks to his excellent screenplay with all that said jefferson has now established himself as a filmmaker to watch and i eagerly await any future projects he may have on the horizoni rate it a very high ",2024-02-08,NA

"society of the snow (2023)","stunning technical achievement","evanstondad","i first read alive at age  yeah probably too young considering its heavy subject matter that book changed my life straightup saved my life ive read that book at least  times over the years i knew all the names all the faces in the black and white photos in that winter wasteland and of course when we read we imagine we put our own visuals into our minds that best fit the narrative as we understand it thru the text on a page the tragedy the desperation and the horror is what stands out at face value and it is a horrific story but unfortunately most people know this story due to the consumption of human flesh to survive but i assure you this is not what this story is about and it never has been the truth is the story of the survivors of the andes is a love story the love for family the love for friends the love for life the story of alive isnt about death so make no mistake and at my lowest points when i thought all was lost this is the story that would creep into my mind and i would imagine theres that word again imagine what it mustve been like to be on the side of that mountain on that glacier in that reallife scenario having to eat my dead friends as i freeze knowing im starving to death watching my brothers starve to death dying from their injuries freezing  up in the andes and no one is looking for you you know the search has been called off  and im trying to imagine that to visualize that because real people lived this experienced this and its almost too much to comprehend to visualize and imagine what that was like not only the outward visual what you see with your eyes the plane the mountain the scene but also the emotion of that experience how do you really ever understand the emotional aspect of such a terrible tragedy the emotion involved in such desperate times thats key here how do you imagine that you cant really if you didnt experience itimaginein   years after i first read the book frank marshall released his version of alive in film form with ethan hawke and i was beyond excited but it failed to capture the emotion of the story and for me it pretty much failed in all aspects a hollywoodized version of the book a complete let down if you havent seen it dont bother i think it kinda sucks it didnt capture what i had imagined it fell flat in my opinion but that was as good as it getseven on the edge of life and death the part of the story that always really stood out to me was in the midst of all that sorrow and pain physical and mental the survivors never lost sight of the natural beauty that surrounded their crashed plane their home in hell the majesty of those mountains with its sharp black rocks the size of buildings reaching to the heavens it was a sight i needed to see with my own eyes i needed to stand in person where that plane had come to a stop broken and twisted i needed to see what they saw i needed to sleep there for a night just to experience  of the story of alive if there was one place on earth i needed to visit it was the valley of tears in argentina high up in the andes one of the most remote places on the planetso i did in january it is probably the most miserable night of my life cold windy hard to breathe because of the altitude couldnt sleep for more than a halfhour at a clip and i wouldnt change it for the world it was here on this trip to south america where i we met alive survivor eduardo strauch urioste he was part of the trip part of our group he accompanied us from the start in mendoza  of us in total and as we stood as a group on that hallowed ground where the crashed plane once rested i was able to see that majesty of those mountains that  headwall to the west the elongated rectangular famous rock in the photos behind the plane i was able to see the thousands of stars in the sky at night not hampered by the lights of civilization the glow of the endless snow in a location shrouded in blackness and even then i would try to imagine the airplane the conversations of the survivors the sickening dread of being the last man alive the sole survivor possibly losing all sanity until he too is gone to the elements forever nothing more than a memoryimagineyou cannot i could not even spending time in that exact location with a man who lived it who encouraged the questions from a bunch of strangers nothing off limits because one doesnt go to this place on a whim you go to this place because it draws you there it invades your mind invades your heart it wont let go and it pulls you there we all had our demons that led us to this place its a place of salvation it calls you in yet i still could not truly imagine envision the reality of those  days in imagineand then after waiting for  years  yes  years  since i read that book as a boy director j a bayona delivers the film society of the snow and i no longer have to try to imagine as ive now seen it on film on a big theater screen and it is intense unlike the first  film this film has character development prior to boarding the illfated flt  and it includes everyone survivors and deceased as it shouldokay the plane crash itself you wont find a more horrific one on film i remember my knees actually shaking when the pilot is trying to pull up the sound of the roaring engines the fear on the faces of the actors the passengers and then impact and no imagining in the world lives up to this scene in the movie horrifyingly real from both outside and inside the plane  the accuracy of the crashed plane itself is almost exact if not totally exact i put pics of the real plane against the movie plane and it is astonshing how accurate that crashed movie plane is to the real thing i no longer have to imagine what it looked like in motion as if i were walking around it because this film does that for us i bring this up first because of course the airplane plays a central role and is the one central material object in fact the detail of this entire film is accurate down to their clothing sunglassesand of course that leads to the mountains because if you saw the  film you would know that didnt look anything like the real place it looked like the canadian rockies because they were not this movie what you see onscreen is the real location where this story takes place everything you see in those mountains surrounding that plane is the real place you want realism accuracy well society of the snow delivers this with perfect detailmakeup if this film doesnt win awards for makeup someone on the awards board needs to be fired this isnt im ethan hawke and i wont grow a beard bs these actors literally look like theyve been starving on the side of a mountain their faces burned by the sun the blistered lips the filth from being stranded for two months the injuries sustained in the crash this is not a bloody gory film nor does it need to be but you do not doubt that these men have been stranded for over two months the realism again leaves little to imagine and thats why were at this movie right to live this story as close as we can for those of us who were not there cinematography the andes are huge and this film captures the immense size of these mountains this location the distances so vast so far and ive been there so i can say on the big screen it does what is intended to show the size and remoteness of these mountains with that little unseen spec of a plane lost and invisible in the glaring white of snow and ice another thing the cinematography captures well is temperature this isnt a little snow machine the film crew used but instead you feel the cold you feel the frozen nights you feel the wind you feel the suffering of what you see on the screen and in my mind probably the most important part of this film you get to see the emotion behind the consumption of the bodies the inner battle they had to face together the pain of the situation that drove them to do the unthinkable but as nando parrado once said in a documentary the human brain will elevate you to heights you didnt believe were possible to survive had you been there you would have been one of us doing what we did no less truth has ever been spoken this is of course a hard decision but to see it played out with such competent actors on a crashed plane set that is an exact copy of the real thing with the expressions of the fear of this act and the revulsion cannot be denied this movie does not bring in the camera to the see the use of the knife nor should it out of respect to all involved families of the deceased and the film doesnt need to you know what is going on from afar and im glad there is no sensationalism of this part of the story but based in truth and the actors really pull this off well we feel for them we see their pain in what they must do to survive and it is heartwrenchingno more imagining this is the film ive waited  years to see  stars aplus and all that sorrow joy and everything in between you dont leave this film without it having an impact on you its not fiction",2024-01-04,NA

straightup saved my life ive read that book at least  times over the years i knew all the names all the faces in the black and white photos in that winter wasteland and of course when we read we imagine we put our own visuals into our minds that best fit the narrative as we understand it thru the text on a page the tragedy the desperation and the horror is what stands out at face value and it is a horrific story but unfortunately most people know this story due to the consumption of human flesh to survive but i assure you this is not what this story is about and it never has been the truth is the story of the survivors of the andes is a love story the love for family the love for friends the love for life the story of alive isnt about death so make no mistake and at my lowest points when i thought all was lost this is the story that would creep into my mind and i would imagine theres that word again imagine what it mustve been like to be on the side of that mountain on that glacier in that reallife scenario having to eat my dead friends as i freeze knowing im starving to death watching my brothers starve to death dying from their injuries freezing  up in the andes and no one is looking for you you know the search has been called off  and im trying to imagine that to visualize that because real people lived this experienced this and its almost too much to comprehend to visualize and imagine what that was like not only the outward visual what you see with your eyes the plane the mountain the scene but also the emotion of that experience how do you really ever understand the emotional aspect of such a terrible tragedy the emotion involved in such desperate times thats key here how do you imagine that you cant really if you didnt experience itimaginein   years after i first read the book frank marshall released his version of alive in film form with ethan hawke and i was beyond excited but it failed to capture the emotion of the story and for me it pretty much failed in all aspects a hollywoodized version of the book a complete let down if you havent seen it dont bother i think it kinda sucks it didnt capture what i had imagined it fell flat in my opinion but that was as good as it getseven on the edge of life and death the part of the story that always really stood out to me was in the midst of all that sorrow and pain physical and mental the survivors never lost sight of the natural beauty that surrounded their crashed plane their home in hell the majesty of those mountains with its sharp black rocks the size of buildings reaching to the heavens it was a sight i needed to see with my own eyes i needed to stand in person where that plane had come to a stop broken and twisted i needed to see what they saw i needed to sleep there for a night just to experience  of the story of alive if there was one place on earth i needed to visit it was the valley of tears in argentina high up in the andes one of the most remote places on the planetso i did in january it is probably the most miserable night of my life cold windy hard to breathe because of the altitude couldnt sleep for more than a halfhour at a clip and i wouldnt change it for the world it was here on this trip to south america where i we met alive survivor eduardo strauch urioste he was part of the trip part of our group he accompanied us from the start in mendoza  of us in total and as we stood as a group on that hallowed ground where the crashed plane once rested i was able to see that majesty of those mountains that  headwall to the west the elongated rectangular famous rock in the photos behind the plane i was able to see the thousands of stars in the sky at night not hampered by the lights of civilization the glow of the endless snow in a location shrouded in blackness and even then i would try to imagine the airplane the conversations of the survivors the sickening dread of being the last man alive the sole survivor possibly losing all sanity until he too is gone to the elements forever nothing more than a memoryimagineyou cannot i could not even spending time in that exact location with a man who lived it who encouraged the questions from a bunch of strangers nothing off limits because one doesnt go to this place on a whim you go to this place because it draws you there it invades your mind invades your heart it wont let go and it pulls you there we all had our demons that led us to this place its a place of salvation it calls you in yet i still could not truly imagine envision the reality of those  days in imagineand then after waiting for  years  yes  years  since i read that book as a boy director j a bayona delivers the film society of the snow and i no longer have to try to imagine as ive now seen it on film on a big theater screen and it is intense unlike the first  film this film has character development prior to boarding the illfated flt  and it includes everyone survivors and deceased as it shouldokay the plane crash itself you wont find a more horrific one on film i remember my knees actually shaking when the pilot is trying to pull up the sound of the roaring engines the fear on the faces of the actors the passengers and then impact and no imagining in the world lives up to this scene in the movie horrifyingly real from both outside and inside the plane  the accuracy of the crashed plane itself is almost exact if not totally exact i put pics of the real plane against the movie plane and it is astonshing how accurate that crashed movie plane is to the real thing i no longer have to imagine what it looked like in motion as if i were walking around it because this film does that for us i bring this up first because of course the airplane plays a central role and is the one central material object in fact the detail of this entire film is accurate down to their clothing sunglassesand of course that leads to the mountains because if you saw the  film you would know that didnt look anything like the real place it looked like the canadian rockies because they were not this movie what you see onscreen is the real location where this story takes place everything you see in those mountains surrounding that plane is the real place you want realism accuracy well society of the snow delivers this with perfect detailmakeup if this film doesnt win awards for makeup someone on the awards board needs to be fired this isnt im ethan hawke and i wont grow a beard bs these actors literally look like theyve been starving on the side of a mountain their faces burned by the sun the blistered lips the filth from being stranded for two months the injuries sustained in the crash this is not a bloody gory film nor does it need to be but you do not doubt that these men have been stranded for over two months the realism again leaves little to imagine and thats why were at this movie right to live this story as close as we can for those of us who were not there cinematography the andes are huge and this film captures the immense size of these mountains this location the distances so vast so far and ive been there so i can say on the big screen it does what is intended to show the size and remoteness of these mountains with that little unseen spec of a plane lost and invisible in the glaring white of snow and ice another thing the cinematography captures well is temperature this isnt a little snow machine the film crew used but instead you feel the cold you feel the frozen nights you feel the wind you feel the suffering of what you see on the screen and in my mind probably the most important part of this film you get to see the emotion behind the consumption of the bodies the inner battle they had to face together the pain of the situation that drove them to do the unthinkable but as nando parrado once said in a documentary the human brain will elevate you to heights you didnt believe were possible to survive had you been there you would have been one of us doing what we did no less truth has ever been spoken this is of course a hard decision but to see it played out with such competent actors on a crashed plane set that is an exact copy of the real thing with the expressions of the fear of this act and the revulsion cannot be denied this movie does not bring in the camera to the see the use of the knife nor should it out of respect to all involved families of the deceased and the film doesnt need to you know what is going on from afar and im glad there is no sensationalism of this part of the story but based in truth

all sanity until he too is gone to the elements forever nothing more than a memoryimagineyou cannot i could not even spending time in that exact location with a man who lived it who encouraged the questions from a bunch of strangers nothing off limits because one doesnt go to this place on a whim you go to this place because it draws you there it invades your mind invades your heart it wont let go and it pulls you there we all had our demons that led us to this place its a place of salvation it calls you in yet i still could not truly imagine envision the reality of those  days in imagineand then after waiting for  years  yes  years  since i read that book as a boy director j a bayona delivers the film society of the snow and i no longer have to try to imagine as ive now seen it on film on a big theater screen and it is intense unlike the first  film this film has character development prior to boarding the illfated flt  and it includes everyone survivors and deceased as it shouldokay the plane crash itself you wont find a more horrific one on film i remember my knees actually shaking when the pilot is trying to pull up the sound of the roaring engines the fear on the faces of the actors the passengers and then impact and no imagining in the world lives up to this scene in the movie horrifyingly real from both outside and inside the plane  the accuracy of the crashed plane itself is almost exact if not totally exact i put pics of the real plane against the movie plane and it is astonshing how accurate that crashed movie plane is to the real thing i no longer have to imagine what it looked like in motion as if i were walking around it because this film does that for us i bring this up first because of course the airplane plays a central role and is the one central material object in fact the detail of this entire film is accurate down to their clothing sunglassesand of course that leads to the mountains because if you saw the  film you would know that didnt look anything like the real place it looked like the canadian rockies because they were not this movie what you see onscreen is the real location where this story takes place everything you see in those mountains surrounding that plane is the real place you want realism accuracy well society of the snow delivers this with perfect detailmakeup if this film doesnt win awards for makeup someone on the awards board needs to be fired this isnt im ethan hawke and i wont grow a beard bs these actors literally look like theyve been starving on the side of a mountain their faces burned by the sun the blistered lips the filth from being stranded for two months the injuries sustained in the crash this is not a bloody gory film nor does it need to be but you do not doubt that these men have been stranded for over two months the realism again leaves little to imagine and thats why were at this movie right to live this story as close as we can for those of us who were not there cinematography the andes are huge and this film captures the immense size of these mountains this location the distances so vast so far and ive been there so i can say on the big screen it does what is intended to show the size and remoteness of these mountains with that little unseen spec of a plane lost and invisible in the glaring white of snow and ice another thing the cinematography captures well is temperature this isnt a little snow machine the film crew used but instead you feel the cold you feel the frozen nights you feel the wind you feel the suffering of what you see on the screen and in my mind probably the most important part of this film you get to see the emotion behind the consumption of the bodies the inner battle they had to face together the pain of the situation that drove them to do the unthinkable but as nando parrado once said in a documentary the human brain will elevate you to heights you didnt believe were possible to survive had you been there you would have been one of us doing what we did no less truth has ever been spoken this is of course a hard decision but to see it played out with such competent actors on a crashed plane set that is an exact copy of the real thing with the expressions of the fear of this act and the revulsion cannot be denied this movie does not bring in the camera to the see the use of the knife nor should it out of respect to all involved families of the deceased and the film doesnt need to you know what is going on from afar and im glad there is no sensationalism of this part of the story but based in truth and the actors really pull this off well we feel for them we see their pain in what they must do to survive and it is heartwrenchingno more imagining this is the film ive waited  years to see  stars aplus and all that sorrow joy and everything in between you dont leave this film without it having an impact on you its not fiction",2024-01-04,NA

"society of the snow (2023)","stunning technical achievement","evanstondad","i first read alive at age  yeah probably too young considering its heavy subject matter that book changed my life straightup saved my life ive read that book at least  times over the years i knew all the names all the faces in the black and white photos in that winter wasteland and of course when we read we imagine we put our own visuals into our minds that best fit the narrative as we understand it thru the text on a page the tragedy the desperation and the horror is what stands out at face value and it is a horrific story but unfortunately most people know this story due to the consumption of human flesh to survive but i assure you this is not what this story is about and it never has been the truth is the story of the survivors of the andes is a love story the love for family the love for friends the love for life the story of alive isnt about death so make no mistake and at my lowest points when i thought all was lost this is the story that would creep into my mind and i would imagine theres that word again imagine what it mustve been like to be on the side of that mountain on that glacier in that reallife scenario having to eat my dead friends as i freeze knowing im starving to death watching my brothers starve to death dying from their injuries freezing  up in the andes and no one is looking for you you know the search has been called off  and im trying to imagine that to visualize that because real people lived this experienced this and its almost too much to comprehend to visualize and imagine what that was like not only the outward visual what you see with your eyes the plane the mountain the scene but also the emotion of that experience how do you really ever understand the emotional aspect of such a terrible tragedy the emotion involved in such desperate times thats key here how do you imagine that you cant really if you didnt experience itimaginein   years after i first read the book frank marshall released his version of alive in film form with ethan hawke and i was beyond excited but it failed to capture the emotion of the story and for me it pretty much failed in all aspects a hollywoodized version of the book a complete let down if you havent seen it dont bother i think it kinda sucks it didnt capture what i had imagined it fell flat in my opinion but that was as good as it getseven on the edge of life and death the part of the story that always really stood out to me was in the midst of all that sorrow and pain physical and mental the survivors never lost sight of the natural beauty that surrounded their crashed plane their home in hell the majesty of those mountains with its sharp black rocks the size of buildings reaching to the heavens it was a sight i needed to see with my own eyes i needed to stand in person where that plane had come to a stop broken and twisted i needed to see what they saw i needed to sleep there for a night just to experience  of the story of alive if there was one place on earth i needed to visit it was the valley of tears in argentina high up in the andes one of the most remote places on the planetso i did in january it is probably the most miserable night of my life cold windy hard to breathe because of the altitude couldnt sleep for more than a halfhour at a clip and i wouldnt change it for the world it was here on this trip to south america where i we met alive survivor eduardo strauch urioste he was part of the trip part of our group he accompanied us from the start in mendoza  of us in total and as we stood as a group on that hallowed ground where the crashed plane once rested i was able to see that majesty of those mountains that  headwall to the west the elongated rectangular famous rock in the photos behind the plane i was able to see the thousands of stars in the sky at night not hampered by the lights of civilization the glow of the endless snow in a

"american fiction (2023)","american fiction is a smart and wellcrafted film an absolute mustsee","kevinrobbins","american fiction is a comedy drama film written and directed by cord jefferson based on the novel erasure by percival everett starring jeffrey wright in the lead role it stands as one of the best written most damning satires about racial stereotypes to hit movie screens in a very long timein los angeles literature professor thelonious monk ellison jeffrey wright is placed on mandatory leave by his university after frequently arguing with his students over differing opinions on racial issues wishing to spend this time off with his family monk travels to boston to meet up with them and later decides to attend a literary seminar taking place nearby monks qa panel receives very little attention due to most of the attendees choosing instead to watch an onstage interview with author sintara golden issa rae whose novel wes lives in da ghetto has become a number one bestseller surprised at how much sintaras book panders to african american stereotypes yet receives such glowing praise from readers monk decides to write his own novel in the exact same style titling it my pafology and loading it up with every cliche imaginable for a black writer under the pen name stagg r leigh monk sends his completed novel to various publishers out of spite and is soon shocked to discover that he is now being offered  and a movie deal for the rights to his storyit can be difficult for creative people to compromise their vision for the sake of pandering to others all too often many writers artists performers and other similar folk are at the mercy of company executives forcing them to make changes to their work as a result of wishing to keep up with the times of course this can yield mixed results as while the creators in question will likely profit greatly from their amended product a major part of their true selves may have been severely altered in the process this is especially the case with the current political climate with many people being forcibly made to acquiesce to modern views on race sexuality and gender identity whether they agree with any of it or not the film american fiction is an excellent example of how it is possible to satirise the worlds view on stereotypes without once resorting to sensationalism or condescensionfrom the very opening scene you can immediately tell what direction this movie is going to take with its satirical point of view we watch as monk a well educated african american university scholar has an argument with one of his white female students regarding the title of a book he is teaching the class the book in question whose title contains a racial slur offends the young student with hair dyed neon green prompting her to question why he isnt offended along with her monk tells the student that if he is capable of understanding the proper context of what is being taught then she can as well which he soon learns the hard way is not the case at all the scathing yet humorous look at the way modern teachers have to deal with these types of students especially from an african american perspective is one of the many reasons this movie works as well as it does this is because it allows the audience to see the hypocrisy of virtue signalling which calls attention to the subconscious racism on display by the very ones who claim to be against itlater on when monk writes his book we watch as he dumbs down every element of his otherwise intelligent storytelling technique gone is his sophisticated writing style and in its place is the stereotypical african american street vernacular spoken by violent gunwielding criminals as the main characters coming from a man with such a highly educated background it becomes obvious to the viewer that it is a painful experience for monk to compromise what could have been a clever indepth story about two black friends but he forcefully presses on to prove his point about pandering to his surprise monks experiment works a little too well and he finds himself offered a large sum of money just for the publishing rights alone on that note perhaps the best way to describe this film is that its like a combination of mel brookss the producers and spike lees blackkklansman as each involve some kind of deceptive plan that goes horribly right for the protagonistin addition to the sharply satirical humour woven throughout the story the film also has its fair share of deeply emotional moments primarily shown through members of monks immediate family although it is shown that monk had a respectable upbringing his family has still been subjected to various ups and downs that have essentially shaped him into the person he is today for instance his mother agnes leslie uggams suffers from early stages of alzheimers disease causing her to forget most of the great achievements he and his other siblings have accomplished throughout their lives because of this monk is forced into an ultimatum move her into an expensive nursing home with his own money or let his siblings sort things out for a cheaper pricealso monks estranged brother cliff sterling k brown has been living a hedonistic lifestyle after divorcing his wife frequently engaging in drug use and sexual encounters we later see that cliff whose divorce was the result of him coming out as gay is now at odds with agnes due to her homophobic views on family values putting a strain on his relationship with her i was highly impressed with the way director cord jefferson was able to juggle all of monks family issues so smoothly while simultaneously keeping the core satirical elements at the forefront of the story most first time filmmakers would greatly falter in this department but jefferson strikes the perfect balance between darkly comical and touchingly dramatic without ever using cheap jokes or unearned sentimentality to get the point acrossin his best film performance to date jeffrey wright does a fantastic job in the role of monk several times throughout the film we witness monk react to all of the bizarre sometimes frustrating things that end up happening to him and wrights facial expressions and body language certainly shine during these scenes in the previously mentioned opening its easy to understand how irritated monk must be at dealing with socially ignorant people like his offended student and the repressed annoyance he shows is both funny and relatable just by the level of self control he has during this situation ive always found wright to be an underrated actor who has never become a household name despite starring in several on screen productions over the years so its nice to see him finally receive some mainstream acknowledgement for his work in this filmworth mentioning as well is sterling k brown as cliff monks estranged homosexual younger brother what i liked most about cliff as a character is the way in which he acts as a reminder to monk of the importance of staying true to himself in one scene which i wont discuss in too much detail due to spoilers we see cliff and monk talking about the long term impact of doing things to appease others rather than yourself this introspective chat about living life your own way is among the most emotionally affecting parts of the film and brown definitely holds his own alongside wright during this particular moment you are really given the sense that these two brothers now share a common ground despite all of their past disagreementstaking into account its timely subject matter cord jeffersons american fiction stands triumphantly as one of the cleverest funniest satirical films to be released in many years its so rare to see a brand new filmmaker get everything right on their first try while at the same time create something that has the potential to be a talking point for generations to come of course jefferson could not have accomplished any of this without the help of the films cast whom he has given them all great material to work with thanks to his excellent screenplay with all that said jefferson has now established himself as a filmmaker to watch and i eagerly await any future projects he may have on the horizoni rate it a very high ",2024-02-08,NA

racial issues wishing to spend this time off with his family monk travels to boston to meet up with them and later decides to attend a literary seminar taking place nearby monks qa panel receives very little attention due to most of the attendees choosing instead to watch an onstage interview with author sintara golden issa rae whose novel wes lives in da ghetto has become a number one bestseller surprised at how much sintaras book panders to african american stereotypes yet receives such glowing praise from readers monk decides to write his own novel in the exact same style titling it my pafology and loading it up with every cliche imaginable for a black writer under the pen name stagg r leigh monk sends his completed novel to various publishers out of spite and is soon shocked to discover that he is now being offered  and a movie deal for the rights to his storyit can be difficult for creative people to compromise their vision for the sake of pandering to others all too often many writers artists performers and other similar folk are at the mercy of company executives forcing them to make changes to their work as a result of wishing to keep up with the times of course this can yield mixed results as while the creators in question will likely profit greatly from their amended product a major part of their true selves may have been severely altered in the process this is especially the case with the current political climate with many people being forcibly made to acquiesce to modern views on race sexuality and gender identity whether they agree with any of it or not the film american fiction is an excellent example of how it is possible to satirise the worlds view on stereotypes without once resorting to sensationalism or condescensionfrom the very opening scene you can immediately tell what direction this movie is going to take with its satirical point of view we watch as monk a well educated african american university scholar has an argument with one of his white female students regarding the title of a book he is teaching the class the book in question whose title contains a racial slur offends the young student with hair dyed neon green prompting her to question why he isnt offended along with her monk tells the student that if he is capable of understanding the proper context of what is being taught then she can as well which he soon learns the hard way is not the case at all the scathing yet humorous look at the way modern teachers have to deal with these types of students especially from an african american perspective is one of the many reasons this movie works as well as it does this is because it allows the audience to see the hypocrisy of virtue signalling which calls attention to the subconscious racism on display by the very ones who claim to be against itlater on when monk writes his book we watch as he dumbs down every element of his otherwise intelligent storytelling technique gone is his sophisticated writing style and in its place is the stereotypical african american street vernacular spoken by violent gunwielding criminals as the main characters coming from a man with such a highly educated background it becomes obvious to the viewer that it is a painful experience for monk to compromise what could have been a clever indepth story about two black friends but he forcefully presses on to prove his point about pandering to his surprise monks experiment works a little too well and he finds himself offered a large sum of money just for the publishing rights alone on that note perhaps the best way to describe this film is that its like a combination of mel brookss the producers and spike lees blackkklansman as each involve some kind of deceptive plan that goes horribly right for the protagonistin addition to the sharply satirical humour woven throughout the story the film also has its fair share of deeply emotional moments primarily shown through members of monks immediate family although it is shown that monk had a respectable upbringing his family has still been subjected to various ups and downs that have essentially shaped him into the person he is today for instance his mother agnes leslie uggams suffers from early stages of alzheimers disease causing her to forget most of the great achievements he and his other siblings have accomplished throughout their lives because of this monk is forced into an ultimatum move her into an expensive nursing home with his own money or let his siblings sort things out for a cheaper pricealso monks estranged brother cliff sterling k brown has been living a hedonistic lifestyle after divorcing his wife frequently engaging in drug use and sexual encounters we later see that cliff whose divorce was the result of him coming out as gay is now at odds with agnes due to her homophobic views on family values putting a strain on his relationship with her i was highly impressed with the way director cord jefferson was able to juggle all of monks family issues so smoothly while simultaneously keeping the core satirical elements at the forefront of the story most first time filmmakers would greatly falter in this department but jefferson strikes the perfect balance between darkly comical and touchingly dramatic without ever using cheap jokes or unearned sentimentality to get the point acrossin his best film performance to date jeffrey wright does a fantastic job in the role of monk several times throughout the film we witness monk react to all of the bizarre sometimes frustrating things that end up happening to him and wrights facial expressions and body language certainly shine during these scenes in the previously mentioned opening its easy to understand how irritated monk must be at dealing with socially ignorant people like his offended student and the repressed annoyance he shows is both funny and relatable just by the level of self control he has during this situation ive always found wright to be an underrated actor who has never become a household name despite starring in several on screen productions over the years so its nice to see him finally receive some mainstream acknowledgement for his work in this filmworth mentioning as well is sterling k brown as cliff monks estranged homosexual younger brother what i liked most about cliff as a character is the way in which he acts as a reminder to monk of the importance of staying true to himself in one scene which i wont discuss in too much detail due to spoilers we see cliff and monk talking about the long term impact of doing things to appease others rather than yourself this introspective chat about living life your own way is among the most emotionally affecting parts of the film and brown definitely holds his own alongside wright during this particular moment you are really given the sense that these two brothers now share a common ground despite all of their past disagreementstaking into account its timely subject matter cord jeffersons american fiction stands triumphantly as one of the cleverest funniest satirical films to be released in many years its so rare to see a brand new filmmaker get everything right on their first try while at the same time create something that has the potential to be a talking point for generations to come of course jefferson could not have accomplished any of this without the help of the films cast whom he has given them all great material to work with thanks to his excellent screenplay with all that said jefferson has now established himself as a

pafology and loading it up with every cliche imaginable for a black writer under the pen name stagg r leigh monk sends his completed novel to various publishers out of spite and is soon shocked to discover that he is now being offered  and a movie deal for the rights to his storyit can be difficult for creative people to compromise their vision for the sake of pandering to others all too often many writers artists performers and other similar folk are at the mercy of company executives forcing them to make changes to their work as a result of wishing to keep up with the times of course this can yield mixed results as while the creators in question will likely profit greatly from their amended product a major part of their true selves may have been severely altered in the process this is especially the case with the current political climate with many people being forcibly made to acquiesce to modern views on race sexuality and gender identity whether they agree with any of it or not the film american fiction is an excellent example of how it is possible to satirise the worlds view on stereotypes without once resorting to sensationalism or condescensionfrom the very opening scene you can immediately tell what direction this movie is going to take with its satirical point of view we watch as monk a well educated african american university scholar has an argument with one of his white female students regarding the title of a book he is teaching the class the book in question whose title contains a racial slur offends the young student with hair dyed neon green prompting her to question why he isnt offended along with her monk tells the student that if he is capable of understanding the proper context of what is being taught then she can as well which he soon learns the hard way is not the case at all the scathing yet humorous look at the way modern teachers have to deal with these types of students especially from an african american perspective is one of the many reasons this movie works as well as it does this is because it allows the audience to see the hypocrisy of virtue signalling which calls attention to the subconscious racism on display by the very ones who claim to be against itlater on when monk writes his book we watch as he dumbs down every element of his otherwise intelligent storytelling technique gone is his sophisticated writing style and in its place is the stereotypical african american street vernacular spoken by violent gunwielding criminals as the main characters coming from a man with such a highly educated background it becomes obvious to the viewer that it is a painful experience for monk to compromise what could have been a clever indepth story about two black friends but he forcefully presses on to prove his point about pandering to his surprise monks experiment works a little too well and he finds himself offered a large sum of money just for the publishing rights alone on that note perhaps the best way to describe this film is that its like a combination of mel brookss the producers and spike lees blackkklansman as each involve some kind of deceptive plan that goes horribly right for the protagonistin addition to the sharply satirical humour woven throughout the story the film also has its fair share of deeply emotional moments primarily shown through members of monks immediate family although it is shown that monk had a respectable upbringing his family has still been subjected to various ups and downs that have essentially shaped him into the person he is today for instance his mother agnes leslie uggams suffers from early stages of alzheimers disease causing her to forget most of the great achievements he and his other siblings have accomplished throughout their lives because of this monk is forced into an ultimatum move her into an expensive nursing home with his own money or let his siblings sort things out for a cheaper pricealso monks estranged brother cliff sterling k brown has been living a hedonistic lifestyle after divorcing his wife frequently engaging in drug use and sexual encounters we later see that cliff whose divorce was the result of him coming out as gay is now at odds with agnes due to her homophobic views on family values putting a strain on his relationship with her i was highly impressed with the way director cord jefferson was able to juggle all of monks family issues so smoothly while simultaneously keeping the core satirical elements at the forefront of the story most first time filmmakers would greatly falter in this department but jefferson strikes the perfect balance between darkly comical and touchingly dramatic without ever using cheap jokes or unearned sentimentality to get the point acrossin his best film performance to date jeffrey wright does a fantastic job in the role of monk several times throughout the film we witness monk react to all of the bizarre sometimes frustrating things that end up happening to him and wrights facial expressions and body language certainly shine during these scenes in the previously mentioned opening its easy to understand how irritated monk must be at dealing with socially ignorant people like his offended student and the repressed annoyance he shows is both funny and relatable just by the level of self control he has during this situation ive always found wright to be an underrated actor who has never become a household name despite starring in several on screen productions over the years so its nice to see him finally receive some mainstream acknowledgement for his work in this filmworth mentioning as well is sterling k brown as cliff monks estranged homosexual younger brother what i liked most about cliff as a character is the way in which he acts as a reminder to monk of the importance of staying true to himself in one scene which i wont discuss in too much detail due to spoilers we see cliff and monk talking about the long term impact of doing things to appease others rather than yourself this introspective chat about living life your own way is among the most emotionally affecting parts of the film and brown definitely holds his own alongside wright during this particular moment you are really given the sense that these two brothers now share a common ground despite all of their past disagreementstaking into account its timely subject matter cord jeffersons american fiction stands triumphantly as one of the cleverest funniest satirical films to be released in many years its so rare to see a brand new filmmaker get everything right on their first try while at the same time create something that has the potential to be a talking point for generations to come of course jefferson could not have accomplished any of this without the help of the films cast whom he has given them all great material to work with thanks to his excellent screenplay with all that said jefferson has now established himself as a

"the pacific (2010)","left me devastated","gogoschka","im guessing most of us watched the pacific for at least one of the following  reasons we have an interest in history particularly in ww we are fans of movies and television shows well the good ones anyway we had seen  and loved  the previous hanksspielberg coproduction band of brothers and expected a miniseries on the same levelnow from reading some of the reviews here i gather that third reason was the most important one for many viewers  and its also why the pacific apparently left quite a few people disappointed as for me i wasnt disappointed  i was devastatedim a lucky man ive never had to suffer through a war but i had relatives who did and though theyre all long gone now ill never forget their stories war is the most extreme and outrageous experience humans can possibly endure but there are many different aspects and layers to it because a war is not a single experience its all the experiences of all the individuals who have to suffer through it and no single film or tv show can cover all of them band of brothers focused on certain aspects of a war and it chose a narrative that helped emphasize what the core theme of the series was the brotherhood of war it was about people who retain their humanity and form the closest of bonds under the worst most horrific circumstancesthat inherently human element in bob was also why we could identify so well with the protagonists and why we were  and still are  so deeply touched by what they had to go through its an outstandingly well made series and i cant imagine how those experiences by those soldiers could have been portrayed better which is why the pacific doesnt even try instead it goes almost in the opposite direction by choosing to focus on the sheer insanity of war the relentless horror and despair of people losing their humanity and their struggle to regain it of course just like bob its also about the heroic sacrifices of those brave soldiers but if there is a core theme in the pacific its that of trauma the trauma of having your humanity stripped from you and your personality shattered the trauma of witnessing the complete disintegration of everything you thought you were and knowing youll never be whole againwhat we see in the pacific is hell plain and simple its scores and scores of anonymous young japanese soldiers running senselessly into machine gun fire wave after wave until the piles of their bodies are so high they block the sight for the machine gun its american soldiers barely older than kids in despair or completely numb from the sheer amount of random death around them its vibrant young men turning into barely alive husks whose only remaining focus is to survive  which means they have to kill other barely alive young men who will stop at nothing to kill them in turn its kids killing other kids like rats by any means at their disposal guns knives flamethrowers or with their bare hands its people living among the rotting corpses of their dead comrades and enemies and completely losing any regard for human life and the few moments where we witness how those kids get a brief taste of how precious and beautiful life could be make their fate all the more heartbreakingover large stretches the pacific is devastating and depressing to watch and though i found it never less than compelling its actually easy to see why many viewers who had hoped for a similarly engaging experience as in bob were left disappointed but this is a different story about different people who fought in a different theater of the war and who went through different experiences and once you stop comparing it to the story of the men in easy company from bob youll find that while different in terms of sheer quality the pacific is every bit as good and as much of an outstanding achievement as its more popular predecessorthe realism the performances the music and the production values in the series are superb this was a  million production after all and the attention to historic detail is simply staggering as for me witnessing what these men went through left me devastated yet i am grateful ive watched the pacifc because in its relentless depiction of the horrors of war it honors the sacrifice these brave young soldiers made in the hope future generations wouldnt have to do the same i originally rated this series  stars out of  but upon a recent rewatch and with more knowledge of the war in the pacific theater its clear that this is a  outstandingfavorite films imdbcomlistmkjokvqlsbslesserknown masterpieces imdbcomlistlsfavorite tvshows reviewed imdbcomlistls",2018-07-07,NA

main characters this is not a perfect series and does suffer from some major flaws but overall its an extremely harrowing experience but one that is needed in an age where war is often glorified this series does anything but that narrative and overall story the pacific is based primarily on two memoirs of us marines with the old breed at peleliu and okinawa by eugene sledge and helmet for my pillow by robert leckie the miniseries follows both these marines sledge played by joe mazzello and leckie james badge dale there is also the addition of marine john basilone jon seda but he is a lesser focus now unlike band of brothers we follow these characters separately as they are part of different divisions the first few episodes follow leckie and his experiences the latter on sledge in a way this is both an interesting way of narration but also maybe the biggest flaw of the series this spilt narration gives us two very separate journeys which in a way bonds us closer to the characters the downfall is that leckies story is just simply not as interesting as sledges from the moment sledge is introduced to us i felt an instant sympathy and connection with him here is this shy awkward eighteen year old desperately longing to fight in the war but unable to do so thanks to a heart mummer of course his determination gets the best of him and enlists the character and his overall story is simply miles more compelling than leckies thats what makes the first three or four episodes somewhat lackluster when the sole focus is on sledge this series reaches its incredible potential and becomes something truly amazing sledge and his journey is really the heart and soul of this seriesacting with such a depressing and intense subject matter first class acting was expected and the pacific delivers every single cast member gives a great performance its gripping and believable acting at its best the stars are undoubtedly joe mazzello who plays sledge and rami malek who plays corporal merriell shelton or snafu a highly intriguing character who forms a close friendship with sledge both give emmy worthy performances and in maleks case i would say oscar worthy these are two very complex and incredible performances mazzello plays our lead which such an intense and subtle power his character goes from a naive and passive teenager to hardened killing machine full of rage it is an incredible character arc and mazzello plays it to perfection as the series comes to a close we really see what mazzello can do sledge is beginning to lose himself he has become ruthless and in one single pivotal scene he regains his humanity his compassion and his redemption its a truly powerful scene and one in which mazzello does not utter one word his face says everything and its heartbreaking in fact that is mazzello main strong point his ability to convey much more than what is going on just by his eyes and face there is so much complex emotion behind his eyes it makes for a fascinating watch rami malek gives the most impressive performance of the series playing snafu his character is incredibly creepy and odd obviously numbed by the horrors of the war but there is something there that makes the audience warm to him malek completely becomes the role every mannerism twitch blink of the eye is perfectly done lines such as i like to watch the new guys sweat are said with such odd intensity its actually mind blowing i will call this performance perfect which is a very rare thing indeed if only malek could win an oscar because this performance truly deserves the highest acclaim malek and mozzello also have fantastic chemistry playing off each other perfectly helping to only further this touching friendshipdirection remember the opening sequence of saving private ryan well imagine that times  i would say this is the most realistic portrayal of what an actual battle must have felt like the battle scenes are simply epic and wonderfully directed even if you hate everything else anyone can see the direction is incredible within this series overall the major flaw of this series if the first  episodes they simply dont have the emotional impact of the rest in fact they border on dull however as soon as sledge and snafu become our main focus this series becomes a true epic this series will take you on a haunting experience you will be horrified you will be moved you will laugh you will cry as long as you stick with it through the first few episodes you will not regret it",2010-05-28,NA

"the pacific (2010)","left me devastated","gogoschka","im guessing most of us watched the pacific for at least one of the following  reasons we have an interest in history particularly in ww we are fans of movies and television shows well the good ones anyway we had seen  and loved  the previous hanksspielberg coproduction band of brothers and expected a miniseries on the same levelnow from reading some of the reviews here i gather that third reason was the most important one for many viewers  and its also why the pacific apparently left quite a few people disappointed as for me i wasnt disappointed  i was devastatedim a lucky man ive never had to suffer through a war but i had relatives who did and though theyre all long gone now ill never forget their stories war is the most extreme and outrageous experience humans can possibly endure but there are many different aspects and layers to it because a war is not a single experience its all the experiences of all the individuals who have to suffer through it and no single film or tv show can cover all of them band of brothers focused on certain aspects of a war and it chose a narrative that helped emphasize what the core theme of the series was the brotherhood of war it was about people who retain their humanity and form the closest of bonds under the worst most horrific circumstancesthat inherently human element in bob was also why we could identify so well with the protagonists and why we were  and still are  so deeply touched by what they had to go through its an outstandingly well made series and i cant imagine how those experiences by those soldiers could have been portrayed better which is why the pacific doesnt even try instead it goes almost in the opposite direction by choosing to focus on the sheer insanity of war the relentless horror and despair of people losing their humanity and their struggle to regain it of course just like bob its also about the heroic sacrifices of those brave soldiers but if there is a core theme in the pacific its that of trauma the trauma of having your humanity stripped from you and your personality shattered the trauma of witnessing the complete disintegration of everything you thought you were and knowing youll never be whole againwhat we see in the pacific is hell plain and simple its scores and scores of anonymous young japanese soldiers running senselessly into machine gun fire wave after wave until the piles of their bodies are so high they block the sight for the machine gun its american soldiers barely older than kids in despair or completely numb from the sheer amount of random death around them its vibrant young men turning into barely alive husks whose only remaining focus is to survive  which means they have to kill other barely alive young men who will stop at nothing to kill them in turn its kids killing other kids like rats by any means at their disposal guns knives flamethrowers or with their bare hands its people living among the rotting corpses of their dead comrades and enemies and completely losing any regard for human life and the few moments where we witness how those kids get a brief taste of how precious and beautiful life could be make their fate all the more heartbreakingover large stretches the pacific is devastating and depressing to watch and though i found it never less than compelling its actually easy to see why many viewers who had hoped for a similarly engaging experience as in bob were left disappointed but this is a different story about different people who fought in a different theater of the war and who went through different experiences and once you stop comparing it to the story of the men in easy company from bob youll find that while different in terms of sheer quality the pacific is every bit as good and as much of an outstanding achievement as its more popular predecessorthe realism the performances the music and the production values in the series are superb this was a  million production after all and the attention to historic detail is simply staggering as for me witnessing what these men went through left me devastated yet i am grateful ive watched the pacifc because in its relentless depiction of the horrors of war it honors the sacrifice these brave young soldiers made in the hope future generations wouldnt have to do the same i originally rated this series  stars out of  but upon a recent rewatch and with more knowledge of the war in the pacific theater its clear that this is a  outstandingfavorite films imdbcomlistmkjokvqlsbslesserknown masterpieces imdbcomlistlsfavorite tvshows reviewed imdbcomlistls",2018-07-07,NA

"the pacific (2010)","left me devastated","gogoschka","im guessing most of us watched the pacific for at least one of the following  reasons we have an interest in history particularly in ww we are fans of movies and television shows well the good ones anyway we had seen  and loved  the previous hanksspielberg coproduction band of brothers and expected a miniseries on the same levelnow from reading some of the reviews here i gather that third reason was the most important one for many viewers  and its also why the pacific apparently left quite a few people disappointed as for me i wasnt disappointed  i was devastatedim a lucky man ive never had to suffer through a war but i had relatives who did and though theyre all long gone now ill never forget their stories war is the most extreme and outrageous experience humans can possibly endure but there are many different aspects and layers to it because a war is not a single experience its all the experiences of all the individuals who have to suffer through it and no single film or tv show can cover all of them band of brothers focused on certain aspects of a war and it chose a narrative that helped emphasize what the core theme of the series was the brotherhood of war it was about people who retain their humanity and form the closest of bonds under the worst most horrific circumstancesthat inherently human element in bob was also why we could identify so well with the protagonists and why we were  and still are  so deeply touched by what they had to go through its an outstandingly well made series and i cant imagine how those experiences by those soldiers could have been portrayed better which is why the pacific doesnt even try instead it goes almost in the opposite direction by choosing to focus on the sheer insanity of war the relentless horror and despair of people losing their humanity and their struggle to regain it of course just like bob its also about the heroic sacrifices of those brave soldiers but if there is a core theme in the pacific its that of trauma the trauma of having your humanity stripped from you and your personality shattered the trauma of witnessing the complete disintegration of everything you thought you were and knowing youll never be whole againwhat we see in the pacific is hell plain and simple its scores and scores of anonymous young japanese soldiers running senselessly into machine gun fire wave after wave until the piles of their bodies are so high they block the sight for the machine gun its american soldiers barely older than kids in despair or completely numb from the sheer amount of random death around them its vibrant young men turning into barely alive husks whose only remaining focus is to survive  which means they have to kill other barely alive young men who will stop at nothing to kill them in turn its kids killing other kids like rats by any means at their disposal guns knives flamethrowers or with their bare hands its people living among the rotting corpses of their dead comrades and enemies and completely losing any regard for human life and the few moments where we witness how those kids get a brief taste of how precious and beautiful life could be make their fate all the more heartbreakingover large stretches the pacific is devastating and depressing to watch and though i found it never less than compelling its actually easy to see why many viewers who had hoped for a similarly engaging experience as in bob were left disappointed but this is a different story about different people who fought in a different theater of the war and who went through different experiences and once you stop comparing it to the story of the men in easy company from bob youll find that while different in terms of sheer quality the pacific is every bit as good and as much of an outstanding achievement as its more popular predecessorthe realism the performances the music and the production values in the series are superb this was a  million production after all and the attention to historic detail is simply staggering as for me witnessing what these men went through left me devastated yet i am grateful ive watched the pacifc because in its relentless depiction of the horrors of war it honors the sacrifice these brave young soldiers made in the hope future generations wouldnt have to do the same i originally rated this series  stars out of  but upon a recent rewatch and with more knowledge of the war in the pacific theater its clear that this is a  outstandingfavorite films imdbcomlistmkjokvqlsbslesserknown masterpieces imdbcomlistlsfavorite tvshows reviewed imdbcomlistls",2018-07-07,NA

through this experience watching in horror as limbs are torn from bodies and men are burned and mutilated in a way even more distressing is watching the emotional scars and effects this has on our main characters this is not a perfect series and does suffer from some major flaws but overall its an extremely harrowing experience but one that is needed in an age where war is often glorified this series does anything but that narrative and overall story the pacific is based primarily on two memoirs of us marines with the old breed at peleliu and okinawa by eugene sledge and helmet for my pillow by robert leckie the miniseries follows both these marines sledge played by joe mazzello and leckie james badge dale there is also the addition of marine john basilone jon seda but he is a lesser focus now unlike band of brothers we follow these characters separately as they are part of different divisions the first few episodes follow leckie and his experiences the latter on sledge in a way this is both an interesting way of narration but also maybe the biggest flaw of the series this spilt narration gives us two very separate journeys which in a way bonds us closer to the characters the downfall is that leckies story is just simply not as interesting as sledges from the moment sledge is introduced to us i felt an instant sympathy and connection with him here is this shy awkward eighteen year old desperately longing to fight in the war but unable to do so thanks to a heart mummer of course his determination gets the best of him and enlists the character and his overall story is simply miles more compelling than leckies thats what makes the first three or four episodes somewhat lackluster when the sole focus is on sledge this series reaches its incredible potential and becomes something truly amazing sledge and his journey is really the heart and soul of this seriesacting with such a depressing and intense subject matter first class acting was expected and the pacific delivers every single cast member gives a great performance its gripping and believable acting at its best the stars are undoubtedly joe mazzello who plays sledge and rami malek who plays corporal merriell shelton or snafu a highly intriguing character who forms a close friendship with sledge both give emmy worthy performances and in maleks case i would say oscar worthy these are two very complex and incredible performances mazzello plays our lead which such an intense and subtle power his character goes from a naive and passive teenager to hardened killing machine full of rage it is an incredible character arc and mazzello plays it to perfection as the series comes to a close we really see what mazzello can do sledge is beginning to lose himself he has become ruthless and in one single pivotal scene he regains his humanity his compassion and his redemption its a truly powerful scene and one in which mazzello does not utter one word his face says everything and its heartbreaking in fact that is mazzello main strong point his ability to convey much more than what is going on just by his eyes and face there is so much complex emotion behind his eyes it makes for a fascinating watch rami malek gives the most impressive performance of the series playing snafu his character is incredibly creepy and odd obviously numbed by the horrors of the war but there is something there that makes the audience warm to him malek completely becomes the role every mannerism twitch blink of the eye is perfectly done lines such as i like to watch the new guys sweat are

"the pacific (2010)","the pacific is no band of brothers and it shouldnt be","johnmcelroynu","i couldnt tell you how many times i have watched band of brothers i think it is the best production ever made however i resisted watching the pacific my father had five years active duty in the marine corps when i was born and remained on active duty until i was  years old i was ten when he left for viet nam the first time and in high school the next i had friends whose fathers were seriously wounded or killed there i have always felt like marines are family and any depiction of them being killed has always been hard to see however i finally decided to manup and watch it on veterans day this yeari think bob was a dream come true for the producers they had ironclad characters to follow all the way through and many of the men were still alive and took part in it the story of easy company had been put into book form brilliantly they didnt have that with the pacific the closest they could come was to base it all around three separate men robert leckieeugene sledge and john basilone the three mens paths crossed somebut they did not belong to the same units or know each other although leckie and sledge both knew basilones reputation as brutal and difficult as the war in europe was the pacific war against the japanese was almost incomprehensible except for their time in australia following guadalcanal they were fighting the most brutal fights in history while in the most punishing places on earthit is a wonder that any of them were ever able to return to civilization and dull the memories of those horrors enough to lead a more or less normal life because of the brutality of both the enemy and the conditions they had to live and fight under there isnt much in the way of lightheartedness the pacific is not as enjoyable as bob anyone seeing it for the first time should not expect to be entertained it is a bit more difficult to get into i found it helpful to watch the first episode twice before going on a little patience in getting to know the primary characters payed off i also think being able to watch it all over the course of a few days like i did was much better than watching it as it was first presented one episode each week for ten weeksthere were some excellent performances in the pacific someone else singled out ravi maleks portrayal of merriel snafu sheldon as award worthy and i agree  i loved william sadler as ltcol lewis chesty puller and i was also very impressed with tom budge as pfc ronnie gibsonthe three primary characters are portrayed worthily i didnt think joe mazzello as sledge developed his character as well as the other two however i ended up with only nine episodes on my dvr the one i am missing is episode five which i suspect is centered on sledge so perhaps the character will seem better developed to me after i see it jon seda gave a fine performance as john basilone which was definitely the roll of a lifetime i think my favorite of the three was james badge dale as bob leckiei wasnt as depressed by seeing a portrayal of so many marines being killed and wounded as i expected that was partly because not many of them really looked like marines to me i have always said that you can put an actor in the marine corps uniform but you usually cant make him look like a marine there were a few though who were totally believable including jon seda others have commented on the length of the mens hair as being distracting andor inaccurate by my first memories in the midlate s marines were wearing the crewcuts and flattops that they have worn ever since however i have pictures of my dad in uniform from a decade earlier with longer hair so i think the producers knew what they were doing therealthough i agree with most posters here that the pacific is not as good as bob it is still welldone and definitely worth seeing i think watching it with an open mind and avoiding comparisons it is a good way to approach it one last comment i have is that i wonder why one young marine who was killed on iwo jima at age  was singled out in the tributes at the end i assume they meant that to symbolize the thousands of young men who were killed and it was very effective imo but i would be interested to know why they chose the one they did if perhaps someone involved in the production was a relative of the young man i wont say his name for those who might not have seen it yet but i will always remember it",2011-10-28,NA

"the pacific (2010)","left me devastated","gogoschka","im guessing most of us watched the pacific for at least one of the following  reasons we have an interest in history particularly in ww we are fans of movies and television shows well the good ones anyway we had seen  and loved  the previous hanksspielberg coproduction band of brothers and expected a miniseries on the same levelnow from reading some of the reviews here i gather that third reason was the most important one for many viewers  and its also why the pacific apparently left quite a few people disappointed as for me i wasnt disappointed  i was devastatedim a lucky man ive never had to suffer through a war but i had relatives who did and though theyre all long gone now ill never forget their stories war is the most extreme and outrageous experience humans can possibly endure but there are many different aspects and layers to it because a war is not a single experience its all the experiences of all the individuals who have to suffer through it and no single film or tv show can cover all of them band of brothers focused on certain aspects of a war and it chose a narrative that helped emphasize what the core theme of the series was the brotherhood of war it was about people who retain their humanity and form the closest of bonds under the worst most horrific circumstancesthat inherently human element in bob was also why we could identify so well with the protagonists and why we were  and still are  so deeply touched by what they had to go through its an outstandingly well made series and i cant imagine how those experiences by those soldiers could have been portrayed better which is why the pacific doesnt even try instead it goes almost in the opposite direction by choosing to focus on the sheer insanity of war the relentless horror and despair of people losing their humanity and their struggle to regain it of course just like bob its also about the heroic sacrifices of those brave soldiers but if there is a core theme in the pacific its that of trauma the trauma of having your humanity stripped from you and your personality shattered the trauma of witnessing the complete disintegration of everything you thought you were and knowing youll never be whole againwhat we see in the pacific is hell plain and simple its scores and scores of anonymous young japanese soldiers running senselessly into machine gun fire wave after wave until the piles of their bodies are so high they block the sight for the machine gun its american soldiers barely older than kids in despair or completely numb from the sheer amount of random death around them its vibrant young men turning into barely alive husks whose only remaining focus is to survive  which means they have to kill other barely alive young men who will stop at nothing to kill them in turn its kids killing other kids like rats by any means at their disposal guns knives flamethrowers or with their bare hands its people living among the rotting corpses of their dead comrades and enemies and completely losing any regard for human life and the few moments where we witness how those kids get a brief taste of how precious and beautiful life could be make their fate all the more heartbreakingover large stretches the pacific is devastating and depressing to watch and though i found it never less than compelling its actually easy to see why many viewers who had hoped for a similarly engaging experience as in bob were left disappointed but this is a different story about different people who fought in a different theater of the war and who went through different experiences and once you stop comparing it to the story of the men in easy company from bob youll find that while different in terms of sheer quality the pacific is every bit as good and as much of an outstanding achievement as its more popular predecessorthe realism the performances the music and the production values in the series are superb this was a  million production after all and the attention to historic detail is simply staggering as for me witnessing what these men went through left me devastated yet i am grateful ive watched the pacifc because in its relentless depiction of the horrors of war it honors the sacrifice these brave young soldiers made in the hope future generations wouldnt have to do the same i originally rated this series  stars out of  but upon a recent rewatch and with more knowledge of the war in the pacific theater its clear that this is a  outstandingfavorite films imdbcomlistmkjokvqlsbslesserknown masterpieces imdbcomlistlsfavorite tvshows reviewed imdbcomlistls",2018-07-07,NA

"the pacific (2010)","different from band of brothers","snoopystyle","the pacific is tom hanks and steven spielbergs epic  million dollar miniseries from the creators of the brilliant  series band of brothers much like with band of brothers the pacific gives us an unflinching look at the horrors of war not just the physical but the mental horrors these men must face as an audience you are pulled through this experience watching in horror as limbs are torn from bodies and men are burned and mutilated in a way even more distressing is watching the emotional scars and effects this has on our main characters this is not a perfect series and does suffer from some major flaws but overall its an extremely harrowing experience but one that is needed in an age where war is often glorified this series does anything but that narrative and overall story the pacific is based primarily on two memoirs of us marines with the old breed at peleliu and okinawa by eugene sledge and helmet for my pillow by robert leckie the miniseries follows both these marines sledge played by joe mazzello and leckie james badge dale there is also the addition of marine john basilone jon seda but he is a lesser focus now unlike band of brothers we follow these characters separately as they are part of different divisions the first few episodes follow leckie and his experiences the latter on sledge in a way this is both an interesting way of narration but also maybe the biggest flaw of the series this spilt narration gives us two very separate journeys which in a way bonds us closer to the characters the downfall is that leckies story is just simply not as interesting as sledges from the moment sledge is introduced to us i felt an instant sympathy and connection with him here is this shy awkward eighteen year old desperately longing to fight in the war but unable to do so thanks to a heart mummer of course his determination gets the best of him and enlists the character and his overall story is simply miles more compelling than leckies thats what makes the first three or four episodes somewhat lackluster when the sole focus is on sledge this series reaches its incredible potential and becomes something truly amazing sledge and his journey is really the heart and soul of this seriesacting with such a depressing and intense subject matter first class acting was expected and the pacific delivers every single cast member gives a great performance its gripping and believable acting at its best the stars are undoubtedly joe mazzello who plays sledge and rami malek who plays corporal merriell shelton or snafu a highly intriguing character who forms a close friendship with sledge both give emmy worthy performances and in maleks case i would say oscar worthy these are two very complex and incredible performances mazzello plays our lead which such an intense and subtle power his character goes from a naive and passive teenager to hardened killing machine full of rage it is an incredible character arc and mazzello plays it to perfection as the series comes to a close we really see what mazzello can do sledge is beginning to lose himself he has become ruthless and in one single pivotal scene he regains his humanity his compassion and his redemption its a truly powerful scene and one in which mazzello does not utter one word his face says everything and its heartbreaking in fact that is mazzello main strong point his ability to convey much more than what is going on just by his eyes and face there is so much complex emotion behind his eyes it makes for a fascinating watch rami malek gives the most impressive performance of the series playing snafu his character is incredibly creepy and odd obviously numbed by the horrors of the war but there is something there that makes the audience warm to him malek completely becomes the role every mannerism twitch blink of the eye is perfectly done lines such as i like to watch the new guys sweat are said with such odd intensity its actually mind blowing i will call this performance perfect which is a very rare thing indeed if only malek could win an oscar because this performance truly deserves the highest acclaim malek and mozzello also have fantastic chemistry playing off each other perfectly helping to only further this touching friendshipdirection remember the opening sequence of saving private ryan well imagine that times  i would say this is the most realistic portrayal of what an actual battle must have felt like the battle scenes are simply epic and wonderfully directed even if you hate everything else anyone can see the direction is incredible within this series overall the major flaw of this series if the first  episodes they simply dont have the emotional impact of the rest in fact they border on dull however as soon as sledge and snafu become our main focus this series becomes a true epic this series will take you on a haunting experience you will be horrified you will be moved you will laugh you will cry as long as you stick with it through the first few episodes you will not regret it",2010-05-28,NA

"spirited away (2001)","exceptional but perhaps not so much for the casual viewer","planktonrules","spirited away is the first miyazaki i have seen but from this stupendous film i can tell he is a master storyteller a hallmark of a good storyteller is making the audience empathise or pull them into the shoes of the central character miyazaki does this brilliantly in spirited away during the first fifteen minutes we have no idea what is going on neither does the main character chihiro we discover the world as chihiro does and its truly amazing to watch but miyazaki doesnt seem to treat this world as something amazing the world is filmed just like our workaday world would the inhabitants of the world go about their daily business as usual as full with apathy as us normal folks places and buildings are not greeted by towering establishing shots and majestic music the fact that this place is amazing doesnt seem to concern miyazaki what do however are the characters miyazaki lingers upon the characters as if they were actors he infixes his animated actors with such subtleties that i have never seen even from animation giants pixar twenty minutes into this film and i completely forgot these were animated characters i started to care for them like they were living and breathing miyazaki treats the modest achievements of chihiro with unashamed bombast the uplifting scene where she cleanses the river god is accompanied by stirring music and is as exciting as watching gladiatorial combatants fight of course by giving the audience developed characters to care about the action and conflicts will always be more exciting terrifying and uplifting than normal generic action scenes through chihiro miyazaki is clearly but nonpatronisingly talking to youth of japan theres a certain sense of revile about the youth of japan at the moment many people consider them to be illmannered and baring no respect for their elders or their forefathers they are simply biproducts of their material world and consumerism spirited away taps into this at the start chihiro is a selfish spoiled whiny brat but as she plunges deeper into the spirit world she becomes more independent more assured more respectful and learns some manners no face a black figure with a white mask is the catalyst behind chihiros transformation once he is let into the bathhouse we are no longer tourists  the story propels forth watching no face prey on the greed of the workers is a terrifying delight the three main characters in miyazakis youth allegory are chihiro no face and b all of these characters are disconnected with their world they are lonely misunderstood and largely ignored but when they go on their journey together they united and become stronger individualsmiyazaki also talks about the ecology of japan what was once a beautiful grassland has now turned into the asian new york that the last samurai had to be filmed in new zealand to get a turn of the century japanese look speaks volumes the river god sequence is an unsubtle but unpretentious commentary on pollution while these two themes are very much current in japan they are also universal themes  which makes spirited away a universal story that most of us can connect with im willing to bet everyone reading this has at some time seen bicycles lying on a lake bed or have had a child talk to them disrespectfully sure these themes arent advanced philosophy they are everyday issues told in an inventive fun waythe animation is wonderful if not as smooth as disneys works  but theres something superior to that spirited aways imperfect but detailed world is far more fascinating than the perfected blandest of disneys latest offerings the animators successfully balanced the tightrope between notenough animation on characters and too much animation on characters no ralph balski add antics here the film is full of vivid images  both beautiful and horrifying the line between those two extremes is crossed over seamlessly from chihiro and haku running through an opening flower field to hakus dragon snarling with a bloody mouth both extremes seem to belong in the film its also excellently done with the characters kamaji can be seen as a scary daunting figure at the beginning but soon he seamlessly changes into a humble wise figure yubaba also seems to be able to turn from kind to witch with the snap

beginning and while i dont speak japanese i think the voice actors did a wonderful job of conveying their personality and emotions true their voice joe hisaishis music is sublime definitely one of my favourite scores his main piano theme is simple and evocative his thunderous action music hits the viewers on the chest like a hammer like all great scores it heightens the greatness of a scene about three times the score unlike many american composers is unobtrusive it plays excellently with the scenes but never overbears them a lot of the time the it is barely noticeable a sole piano plays softly in the background evoking a dreamlikelullaby quality spirited away is a simply a modern masterpiece easily one of the top  films of the new millennium it works on a multitude of levels a social commentary on japan a homage to ancient japaneserussian mythology a moral film for both children and adults but most importantly it is a simple story brilliantly told by a great filmmaker who appears

"spirited away (2001)","great","u","last year i saw spirited away on its uk release ive never been a particular fan of anime and it didnt really occur to me that i was watching a foreign language film dubbed into english or american i cant imagine seeing a live action foreign language film dubbed into another language but hey this is a kids cartoon what does it matter up to a point it didnt because i loved the film i enjoyed it so much i set about digging up the studio ghiblimiyazaki back catalogue in the process sprited away was filed away as one of the lesser ghiblis  still great but compared to laputa grave of the fireflies and a few others it seemed a little weak but i recently rewatched it on dvd with the subtitles and found the difference unbelievable the film came alive like the other miyazakis ive seen it seemed infinitely more layered detailed intelligent and witty than i remembered could it be that retaining the intended performances even if the words are unintelligible can make that much difference maybe the dub was just poorly done or was it just because i was now versed in the language of ghibli as a little experiment i decided to rewatch some of the film with both the english subtitles and english language dub in order to compare i ended watching the whole thing out of morbid fascination its simply amazing what a difference there is entire scenes change its not just that subtle emphasis is shifted or the same points are made in a different manner  in the dub the subject of whole conversations and scenes are changed and often to some flat and uninteresting hokum relationships between characters are changed their motivations and personalities are changed the difference is shocking i appreciate western and particularly american audiences can be put off by subtitles and cinemas are less likely to show the film anyway its pointless to be all righteous when fundamentally you just want people to see the film unless they do this treasure trove will remain undiscovered and maybe finding it will encourage people to conquer the subtitle demon as miyazaki might call him but the problem is the quality of these dubs and the liberties taken with the source material of course without speaking japanese who can say its not the subtitles that are way off theyre probably written by westerners too but the dub just stinks of disneyfication saturday morning generic nonsense the challenging uncompromising and emotionally ambitious nature of the film is severely watered downa fair question might be if its so bad why was it so successful the success is evidence of the films staggering quality even so it hardly challenged whatever jerry bruckheimer movie was showing at the time in japan its the biggest grossing film in history go figure as chihiro wouldnt say",2004-10-18,NA

master storyteller a hallmark of a good storyteller is making the audience empathise or pull them into the shoes of the central character miyazaki does this brilliantly in spirited away during the first fifteen minutes we have no idea what is going on neither does the main character chihiro we discover the world as chihiro does and its truly amazing to watch but miyazaki doesnt seem to treat this world as something amazing the world is filmed just like our workaday world would the inhabitants of the world go about their daily business as usual as full with apathy as us normal folks places and buildings are not greeted by towering establishing shots and majestic music the fact that this place is amazing doesnt seem to concern miyazaki what do however are the characters miyazaki lingers upon the characters as if they were actors he infixes his animated actors with such subtleties that i have never seen even from animation giants pixar twenty minutes into this film and i completely forgot these were animated characters i started to care for them like they were living and breathing miyazaki treats the modest achievements of chihiro with unashamed bombast the uplifting scene where she cleanses the river god is accompanied by stirring music and is as exciting as watching gladiatorial combatants fight of course by giving the audience developed characters to care about the action and conflicts will always be more exciting terrifying and uplifting than normal generic action scenes through chihiro miyazaki is clearly but nonpatronisingly talking to youth of japan theres a certain sense of revile about the youth of japan at the moment many people consider them to be illmannered and baring no respect for their elders or their forefathers they are simply biproducts of their material world and consumerism spirited away taps into this at the start chihiro is a selfish spoiled whiny brat but as she plunges deeper into the spirit world she becomes more independent more assured more respectful and learns some manners no face a black figure with a white mask is the catalyst behind chihiros transformation once he is let into the bathhouse we are no longer tourists  the story propels forth watching no face prey on the greed of the workers is a terrifying delight the three main characters in miyazakis youth allegory are chihiro no face and b all of these characters are disconnected with their world they are lonely misunderstood and largely ignored but when they go on their journey together they united and become stronger individualsmiyazaki also talks about the ecology of japan what was once a beautiful grassland has now turned into the asian new york that the last samurai had to be filmed in new zealand to get a turn of the century japanese look speaks volumes the river god sequence is an unsubtle but unpretentious commentary on pollution while these two themes are very much current in japan they are also universal themes  which makes spirited away a universal story that most of us can connect with im willing to bet everyone reading this has at some time seen bicycles lying on a lake bed or have had a child talk to them disrespectfully sure these themes arent advanced philosophy they are everyday issues told in an inventive fun waythe animation is wonderful if not as smooth as disneys works  but theres something superior to that spirited aways imperfect but detailed world is far more fascinating than the perfected blandest of disneys latest offerings the animators successfully balanced the tightrope between notenough animation on characters and too much animation on characters no ralph balski add antics here the film is full of vivid images  both beautiful and horrifying the line between those two extremes is crossed over seamlessly from chihiro and haku running through an opening flower field to hakus dragon snarling with a bloody mouth both extremes seem to belong in the film its also excellently done with the characters kamaji can be seen as a scary daunting figure at the beginning but soon he seamlessly changes into a humble wise figure yubaba also seems to be able to turn from kind to witch with the snap of a finger the sound on the film was expertly done the sounds perfectly match the on screen actions and objects my sub woofer got a wonderful workout when haku swoops chihiro past the bridge at the beginning and while i dont speak japanese i think the voice actors did a wonderful job of conveying their personality and emotions true their voice joe hisaishis music is sublime definitely one of my favourite scores his main piano theme is simple and evocative his thunderous action music hits the viewers on the chest like a hammer like all great scores it heightens the greatness of a scene about three times the score unlike many american composers is unobtrusive it plays excellently with the scenes but never overbears them a lot of the time the it is barely noticeable a sole piano plays softly in the background evoking a dreamlikelullaby quality spirited away is a simply a modern masterpiece easily one of the top  films of the new millennium it works on a multitude of levels a social commentary on japan a homage to ancient japaneserussian mythology a moral film for both children and adults but most importantly it is a simple story brilliantly told by a great filmmaker who appears

"spirited away (2001)","i dont really know what to say","morejambo","this is a wonderfully imaginative and fantastical childrens fantasy it is easy to see why it was perhaps the critical hit of  the film is glorious to look at it is a testament to old fashioned animation techniques that seem to be resigned to foreign animations of course there is some use of computer imagery for certain shots but they blend seamlessly and the overall artistry involved is superlativethis is the first hayao miyazaki film i have seen and i will certainly watch his others the story plays on many elements successful with kids films that transport you back to your own childhood and also allows the young audience to connect with the themes in the movie too the story centres around chihiro a young girl about to move into a new place and who feels insecure about the new environment she will be living in these fears become a part of her encounter with a strange abandoned amusement park that she and her parents find when they reach a dead end in their car at the park they find that their is a stall that is seemingly open with glorious displays of mouth watering food there are no people about but chihiros parents decide to gorge themselves on this bounty and pay later as chihioro explores she comes across a strange boy who warns her to get out before dark it is too late however because as night falls ghosts are awakened and then by the time she gets back to her parents they are turned into pigs she then finds that the route she came from is gone and she is now trapped in this place her only allie being the boy she met earlier she is told to get a job at the centre piece of the park a bath house run by yubaba an evil power mad witch this is a bath house for the spirits and chihiro has to find a job there before she is found and turned into an animal herself then unable to save her parentsthe story is imaginative and the characters and animations endlessly unique and strange this is just so much more creative than hollywood the characters are likeable and we become engrossed with chihiros adventures inside this bathhouse and the characters she comes into contact with as she tries to get her parents back as humans and whilst trying to get back to the human world what i also loved in this film is that the animation gives it a real sense of cinematography the drawing makes the film stand out in a way that american animations rarely do another film i think of that looked really good was bellville rendezvous another great point in fact the best part of it is the fantastic score it really is uplifting and very original this is just great film making ",2004-04-02,NA

"spirited away (2001)","exceptional but perhaps not so much for the casual viewer","planktonrules","spirited away is the first miyazaki i have seen but from this stupendous film i can tell he is a master storyteller a hallmark of a good storyteller is making the audience empathise or pull them into the shoes of the central character miyazaki does this brilliantly in spirited away during the first fifteen minutes we have no idea what is going on neither does the main character chihiro we discover the world as chihiro does and its truly amazing to watch but miyazaki doesnt seem to treat this world as something amazing the world is filmed just like our workaday world would the inhabitants of the world go about their daily business as usual as full with apathy as us normal folks places and buildings are not greeted by towering establishing shots and majestic music the fact that this place is amazing doesnt seem to concern miyazaki what do however are the characters miyazaki lingers upon the characters as if they were actors he infixes his animated actors with such subtleties that i have never seen even from animation giants pixar twenty minutes into this film and i completely forgot these were animated characters i started to care for them like they were living and breathing miyazaki treats the modest achievements of chihiro with unashamed bombast the uplifting scene where she cleanses the river god is accompanied by stirring music and is as exciting as watching gladiatorial combatants fight of course by giving the audience developed characters to care about the action and conflicts will always be more exciting terrifying and uplifting than normal generic action scenes through chihiro miyazaki is clearly but nonpatronisingly talking to youth of japan theres a certain sense of revile about the youth of japan at the moment many people consider them to be illmannered and baring no respect for their elders or their forefathers they are simply biproducts of their material world and consumerism spirited away taps into this at the start chihiro is a selfish spoiled whiny brat but as she plunges deeper into the spirit world she becomes more independent more assured more respectful and learns some manners no face a black figure with a white mask is the catalyst behind chihiros transformation once he is let into the bathhouse we are no longer tourists  the story propels forth watching no face prey on the greed of the workers is a terrifying delight the three main characters in miyazakis youth allegory are chihiro no face and b all of these characters are disconnected with their world they are lonely misunderstood and largely ignored but when they go on their journey together they united and become stronger individualsmiyazaki also talks about the ecology of japan what was once a beautiful grassland has now turned into the asian new york that the last samurai had to be filmed in new zealand to get a turn of the century japanese look speaks volumes the river god sequence is an unsubtle but unpretentious commentary on pollution while these two themes are very much current in japan they are also universal themes  which makes spirited away a universal story that most of us can connect with im willing to bet everyone reading this has at some time seen bicycles lying on a lake bed or have had a child talk to them disrespectfully sure these themes arent advanced philosophy they are everyday issues told in an inventive fun waythe animation is wonderful if not as smooth as disneys works  but theres something superior to that spirited aways imperfect but detailed world is far more fascinating than the perfected blandest of disneys latest offerings the animators successfully balanced the tightrope between notenough animation on characters and too much animation on characters no ralph balski add antics here the film is full of vivid images  both beautiful and horrifying the line between those two extremes is crossed over seamlessly from chihiro and haku running through an opening flower field to hakus dragon snarling with a bloody mouth both extremes seem to belong in the film its also excellently done with the characters kamaji can be seen as a scary daunting figure at the beginning but soon he seamlessly changes into a humble wise figure yubaba also seems to be able to turn from kind to witch with the snap of a finger the sound on the film was expertly done the sounds perfectly match the on screen actions and objects my sub woofer got a wonderful workout when haku swoops chihiro past the bridge at the beginning and while i dont speak japanese i think the voice actors did a wonderful job of conveying their personality and emotions true their voice joe hisaishis music is sublime definitely one of my favourite scores his main piano theme is simple and evocative his thunderous action music hits the viewers on the chest like a hammer like all great scores it heightens the greatness of a scene about three times the score unlike many american composers is unobtrusive it plays excellently with the scenes but never overbears them a lot of the time the it is barely noticeable a sole piano plays softly in the background evoking a dreamlikelullaby quality spirited away is a simply a modern masterpiece easily one of the top  films of the new millennium it works on a multitude of levels a social commentary on japan a homage to ancient japaneserussian mythology a moral film for both children and adults but most importantly it is a simple story brilliantly told by a great filmmaker who appears to be at the top of his game spirited away works much like a relaxing journey pop in the dvd leave this world for two hours and when you will be almost certainly enriched and ready to take the trip

"raiders of the lost ark (1981)","one of the great films of spielbergs career and one of the greatest adventure films of all time","fernandoschiavi","it was born from the minds of some of the leading filmmakers of the moment but an adventure that would become one of the leading film franchises george lucas had just created and launched two scifi classics with the first two chapters of the star wars saga while spielberg was also already considered one of the most promising directors in hollywood having effect astonishing successes with jaws  and close encounters of the third kind  classic recipe for matinees adored by george lucas the work of screenwriter lawrence kasdan is one of the most consistent doing an excellent job of keeping to the basics virtually all characters in the raiders of the lost ark are based on archetypes but none of them lack personality indy himself is one of the most famous characters in american cinema fitting the profile of the classic action hero but with several peculiarities that make him special from his acid sense of humor his clumsy way to achieve a goal and also his intelligence all villains are purposefully shallow and manichean with nazism incorporating all the evil on earth in a cartoonish way but that never sounds strange in this proposalin raiders of the lost ark spielberg makes his first openly action movie even though duel jaws and  had their setpieces there here is a popcorn adventure from start to finish and this is a category in which the filmmaker would become an expert the opening scene alone is a lesson in how to introduce a character and his universe with spielbergs camera keeping a mystery about indys identity  douglas slocombes photograph skillfully covers fords face with shadows  but building your personality and your iconic figure through frames that portray your courage and demonstrate your skills see the closed planes of the hat the leather jacket and the whip on the long belt before the protagonist draws it against an attacker it is an aesthetic care and well elaborated by the filmmakers camera game which is maintained throughout the films other numerous action sequences between shootings in bars races to stop a truck and a fist fight on an airstrip what most charm the project is the ability of the filmmaker to create an atmosphere of tension that embarks on a frantic and goodnatured adventure is one of the great strengths of the feature guaranteeing the film never to lose its rhythm while the characters go over obstacle after obstacle as in a real board game spielbergs ability to command the action is present in the most naive scenes such as the snake pit or the fight in the nazi plane even in the most elaborate ones such as the chase of trucks involving jones and several soldiersclassic backstage story it was harrison fords suggestion that indy when faced by a skilled swordsman in the cairo market simply shoot his opponent instead of starting an elaborate fight with his whip  as the script originally said a sensational improvisation that came out of the mere fact that ford and several members of the team were sick because of the heat and the local food and that perfectly ended up defining one of indys personality traits throughout two other action scenes the hero asks an opponent to wait while he prepares to return to the fight and casually answers one of his colleagues who asks him what his plan is i dont know i invent on the way priceless phrases and actions and that only harrison ford would be able to deliver with such charisma and naturalness in what is definitely the most striking role of his remarkable career ford is loose unlike what he commonly complained of han solo here he can show some more facets and not a predominant one as is the extremely obvious scoundrel antihero he is incredulous that the journey he will take will result in something really in the encounter with something divine in fact in addition to being able to represent well the teacher for whom his students sigh besides of course to reproduce the clich of forbidden love for someone of the past in this case marion the strong and feminine character of karen allen a woman who is clearly not a fulltime damsel in distresswith special care for the action what is also striking is how spielberg maintains his same technical eye for the most expository scenes for example the scene where indy and brody denholm elliott are approached by government officials and the archaeologist explains the ark of the covenant myth to them spielberg films much of the dialogue in an open plan with all four characters there welldisposed through a mise en scne that puts the agents  and the spectator  in a classroom where indy even uses the blackboard to present some concepts that will become important in the future an exhibition that does not sound forced after all the protagonist is in fact a teacher we also see spielbergs brand developing where the filmmaker works on long shots that always change the characters positions and the graceful movement of the camera giving the strong impression that a cut has happened but remaining in the same shot iconography is also a factor that spielberg and slocombe masterfully explore as in the scene where indy visits marion in her bar casting a giant shadow on the girl but being marion a fearless woman  and the most memorable one in the archaeologists gallery  she is very capable of opposing the presence of indy and the shadow soon fades over the course of the conversationthe master of star wars songs conductor john williams had already been working with spielberg since jaws and not tired of delivering memorable themes he reaches one of the culminations of his career with the indiana jones musical piece it is a cheerful adventurous and even flashy theme which summarizes all the feelings and themes of the franchise as well as offering emotionally demarcated tracks such as the love theme with marion and the most oppressive and heavy orchestra to portray the nazis another work of genius for a changebeing an example of the s and literally beginning the decade the overwhelming majority of the special effects of hunters are done in a practical way being done in the studio unlike the digital effects so common today it is very good that spielberg did not like his friend george lucas who adapted the effects of star wars for the current times which would be to deny the nature of the film and the time in which it was made the snake scene was made with real snakes and that scene with a cobra was filmed with a cobra between a glass panel and the actor the giant ball at the beginning is actually a giant ball and the scene where indiana jones is dragged by a car was filmed that way with some stuntmen obviously but harrison ford himself was dragged by the car at one point we have rubber dolls and animatronics to serve as the dead henchmen while the need for a more supernatural practically takes the film on a path of trash terror anyone who watched the film as a child is forever scarred by the images of nazis having their faces twisted exploded and melted when the ark demonstrates the magnitude and horror of its power and spielberg and his team have fun here okay the matte paintings and projections of the spirits of the ark are images that today appear considerably dated but still have an impact as well as the wonderful eighth of the nazi ernst toht ronald lacey literally melting before our eyesone of the great films of spielbergs career and one of the greatest adventure films of all time the film despite being a big blockbuster still has personal traits of the director who is jewish so dont think that the nazis are villains by chance spielberg prints in caadores gains a strong and constant critical subtext that enriches the cinematographic experience combining narrative lightness with very strong strikes against the most murderous regime of the th century it is almost like a form of indoctrination in which a certain political position was instilled in the subconscious without our realizing itraiders of the lost ark borders on perfection as it shows that the academic or scientific search can evidently solve some mysteries while so many others are apparently instituted to be solved with time and investigations that will last for the lives and generations of many scholars and this feeling gains even more strength with the scene that precedes the credits where you see a shed with numerous artifacts kept all waiting to star in one or more adventures of indiana and yourswith all these elements well balanced  including a predilection for fantasy  the raiders of the lost ark became one of the biggest commercial successes in cinema history competing for eight oscars and taking four starting a millionaire franchise and also generating several imitations we witnessed a perfect adventure film here being one of the most dignified and perfect examples that the genre has ever seen indiana jones is already born an iconic figure thanks to the good ideas of george lucas and the technical virtuosity of steven spielberg who delivers his first great action film in a fun and intelligent way using the nostalgia of a very specific period to create something completely new",2020-02-23,NA

a few moments at a time for such an older character the film really stuns with some of its fantastical ideas sure it is obvious this is a film that could only ever be done as an animated film but what it lacks in realism it makes up for in fun  something that has been sorely missing from the movies for years it came back for a short while with the first pirates of the caribbean film but the focus as of late for any film has been on deeply conflicted depressing narratives and while this film is struck with having some of the most depressing scenes the year has seen so far it never wallows in

idea the former balloon salesman ties thousands of balloons to his house and simply floats away en route to his dream adventure except he is not alone  young wilderness explorer russell jordan nagai inadvertently shows up in midair and carl sees no other choice but to bring the boy with himthe fact that this plot line is even relevant enough to get made into a movie is more than enough reason to praise up ever since toy story pixar has consistently delivered the most radically original and unique ideas for animated films and live action films sure not all of them are as amazing as others cars is quite simply stale compared to the likes of ratatouille and walle but there is something brilliantly imaginative and exciting going on at the studio and up is no exceptioncoming off the breakthrough of walle i was not expecting the same reaction to up but i was more than just pleasantly surprised the film is hilarious heartfelt moving and depressing all at once this may sound like it is an issue and that the film has a problem holding its ground with its tonal structure but instead it handles it quite well splitting the film into quadrants and allowing the themes and plot line to coincide with whatever emotional response the filmmakers are going for and while there is plenty for young children to enjoy and take from the film it is the older audience that will get the biggest reaction from it there is a lot going on in the film but it never loses its speed and never loses control of what it wants to say and do it knows exactly where it wants to be and when and where other recent pixar films have failed specifically in their lengthy runtimes and frequent need to drag themselves out up does not it practically blasts its way through its beginning all the way up to its ending with time left to sparewhat makes up work so well much like walle before it is the focus on very few characters where walle spent the majority of its runtime primarily on earth with its main character a love interest and a cockroach up spends its majority with carl russell a bird named kevin and a talking dog named dug voiced by codirector bob peterson it does allow for more characters to enter in later on but the focus never strays from these main characters some may say the film is trying to tell multiple stories but as the film progresses it is clear it is telling one story  the tale of a man who never experienced what he wanted the most the film builds up carls backstory heavily in startlingly moving moments that surprisingly were surprisingly kept rather secretive in the marketing for the film we know from the very first trailer that carl is a fairly mean old man but the film spends a great deal of time to develop him into an emotional wreck of a manbut the real success of the film is in its imagination and adventure while walle is perhaps the most startlingly unique and original animated picture of the last decade up still manages to pack in a lot of uniqueness but while walle got caught up in its own environmentally sound message up sticks with being an almost straight adventure picture it is frequently thrilling and exciting and lets up only for a few moments at a time for such an older character the film really stuns with some of its fantastical ideas sure it is obvious this is a film that could only ever be done as an animated film but what it lacks in realism it makes up for in fun  something that has been sorely missing from the movies for years it came back for a short while with the first pirates of the caribbean film but the focus as of late for any film has been on deeply conflicted depressing narratives and while this film is struck with having some of the most depressing scenes the year has seen so far it never wallows in the sadness it throws the moments at you and then quickly moves on and as said previously the tonal shifts work excellently in ups favourbut of course an animated movie cannot work without its animation while up is not a breakthrough in the way other pixar films have been it keeps with the tradition of still looking stunning and leading the curve for computer animated films it does look cartoony and fantastical in many instances but this only continues to work towards it being even better the locales are realistic looking the dog fur is near perfect for me watching carls facial hair gradually grow in as the story moves along was simply amazing the little details and minute perfections have always been key to the pixar films and up is no different additionally the d effects really add a layer to the film and bring the movie to life unlike other recent efforts like monsters vs aliens and bolti cannot praise up enough words cannot do justice for how excellent the film is pixar continues to outdo itself year after year even with their subpar films while each film has their own flaws up revels in being as close to perfect as the company has been in years i adored every minute and look forward to watching it again with an even bigger smile on my face",2015-09-23,NA

"owl's moving castle (2004)","great provided you are not a huge diana wynne jones fan or watch the film with one","planktonrules","i went to see this film with my anime and diana wynne jonesloving teenage daughter and while i enjoyed the film immensely due to its excellent animation story and overall sense of fun it was also interesting to see how much my daughter hated it it was as if we saw two entirely different films why well she is a huge diana wynne jones fan and has read and reread just about everything she ever wrote and according to her the story was so different and so inferior to the book that she disliked the film and said some very nasty things about director miyazaki however my advice is dont read the book and just go and see the movie then after enjoying it read the book only if you are  sure you can do this without freaking out because they are so different i didnt know the difference and had a great time seeing the film",2005-06-06,NA
"owl's moving castle (2004)","this is art","soanimed","howls moving castle is as marvelous and magical as miyazakis other great work something in disneys advertising or the description i read gave the false impression that it was going to be substandard work meaning it was still going to be better than anything dreamworks animation was doing madagascar was sooo pedestrianwhile not as aweinspiring as spirited away or actionpacked as mononoke it does work on the level of kikis delivery service as a girl is forced to be better than she thinks she can be well thats not a big surprise thats all his films and as with all miyazaki stories the story teaches without being preachy and the lessons learned are represented in character changes and in the characters physical appearance as well its that same attention to detail that has made pixar so greatthe animation is wonderful the castle is itself is a meshmash of so many haphazardly arranged pieces that an engineer would have an aneurysm just sorting them all out and yet it works through magic of course the magic being howls and the authoritative hand of miyazakis direction the airships wow airships in a miyazaki film who would have thunk are great variations of ones hes used before and there are some rather dark and beautiful scenes of a world at warmost of the voice work was very strong including christian bale howl and emily mortimer as the young version of the heroine sophie the voice that surprised me was billy crystal as calcifer the little flame that could hes the heart of the castle and only annoyed at his first few scenes then becomes a very likable characterthere a few clunky moments in the plot line where transitions between story points werent very strong but overall its another outstanding film from studio ghibli even my  year old partner who had spent the day mountain biking was dead tired and had never seen a miyazaki film stayed awake for the entire  hours when we left at  in the morning still jabbering away about all the imagery and meaning we realized we had seen true art",2006-02-05,NA
"owl's moving castle (2004)","try to decode the story ","kengoogloo","i tried liking this movie i dont get what all the hype is about it is very hard to follow basically this old witch turns this little girl who works at a hat shop into an old woman the girl doesnt mind too much because shes always been sort of an old soul anyways she runs away from home because she doesnt want anyone seeing her as an old woman she then runs into this randomass scarecrow finally she comes across the titular moving castle although at this point in the story she has already had a runin with the owner howlthe moving castle is so confusing there are so many weird and awkward aspects of it such as a spinning color wheel by the door i respect the creative animation but it just doesnt spark my imagination the way that other films by miyazaki do halfway through the movie the old witch who turns the protagonist into an old woman suddenly becomes one of the good guys for no apparent reason howl is supposed to be mysterious and heroic but he comes off more as arrogant and annoying he is overall not a very likable character hes a clich anim pretty boyi understand that this movie is a criticism of war i can respect that but its just kind of all over the place there is no real continuity maybe im too dumb to grasp how good it really is ill give it another shot but i must say i was a little underwhelmed and very confused by this movie",2021-09-04,NA
"owl's moving castle (2004)","confusing as hell","robertrutledge","maybe the only way to enjoy this movie is to think of it more as a visual symphony than a cohesive narrative like fantasia or somethingi had soooo many questions i needed answers for and while i got some of them from the ending for the most part im just left scratching my head and wondering what the heck i just watchedseriously not even plot holes just missing pieces of plot so much information is never given and its absence is feltis the war somehow howls fault where the heck did sophies mom come fromwho was the witch who was the other witch is sophie a witch why did the first witch curse sophie why was the second witch so mad was she mad or am i projecting on and on it goessigh stars all in all i think that its a very pretty movie with decent animation but there are better ghibli films for both animation and story",2020-06-25,NA
